One is going to be an amendment that will encourage a transition of our Federal Government's vehicle fleet from the current practice of burning gasoline mostly, and I encourage the adoption of natural gas as an alternative fuel because natural gas is cleaner, it is domestic, it is actually cheaper. Without any government subsidy or taxpayer help, natural gas is a cheaper source of fuel.\",\n                \"We have a staggering quantity. The United States is the world's No. 1 producer of natural gas. We have 2.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas.

It is a staggering amount.\",\n                \"I have another amendment that also has bipartisan support. I thank Senator Feinstein, Senators Flake and Manchin for supporting the effort to repeal the corn ethanol mandate in our fuel. This is a very bad policy that we have had for far too long. It is time to end this mandate that we grow corn and use it to burn in our gas tanks. It is a practice that is bad for the environment. It raises the cost of filling our tanks. It raises the cost of food because so much of our corn production goes into this, and it is not good for our engines. There is no good reason to continue this, and I look forward to having the debate that will enable us to repeal the corn ethanol mandate.\",\n                \"But the amendment I wish to talk about is another bipartisan amendment. I thank Senator Casey for being the Democratic cosponsor for this amendment, and I thank Senator Hatch for joining me. This is an amendment that will preserve an important, environmentally beneficial source of alternative energy that we have especially in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and it is under threat by two new rules that have been proposed by the EPA.\",\n                \"Let me give a little bit of background as to why we have gotten to this place. In Pennsylvania and West Virginia we have been mining coal for well over a century, and for many of the decades, especially in the early years of our coal development, we took the high-energy density coal and our coal miners sold it to the steel industry where it was used in the manufacturing process of making steel, and the low-energy coal was left in piles--huge piles--actually mountains. It is often referred to as waste coal.\",\n                \"The first photograph illustrates one of these waste coal piles. It is in Nanty Glo in Cambria County, PA. It is one of many piles or, as I say, mountains throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that there are 2 billion tons of waste coal such as this covering 180,000 acres in Pennsylvania alone. Think about that. It is a massive scale because of over a century of legacy of coal mining. Some of these piles are literally in people's backyards. \",\n                \"Here we can see the people who live literally within a stone's throw--if you have a reasonably good arm--within a stone's throw you can reach this pile. That is also Nanty Glo in Cambria County. There are people who live within a couple of hundred feet.\",\n                \"What is the problem with these mountains? The problem with these mountains of coal is it rains on them, and when it rains the runoff is horrendous. It looks like this. It looks like this in every one of these mountains of waste coal everywhere that one exists, every time it rains. In 2003 in an op-ed entitled ``The Benefits of Waste Coal,'' former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell's Department of Environmental Protection secretary, whose name is Kathleen McGinty, wrote: ``For years these piles sat abandoned, generating iron, manganese and aluminum pollution that discharged as runoff into Pennsylvania's waterways.''\",\n                \"That is exactly what happens when these piles just sit here.\",\n                \"In 2011 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection report states:\",\n                \"Coal refuse piles that are not removed (i.e. burned for fuel) generally create severe acid mine drainage, with pH in the 2.5 range . . .\",\n                \"A pH that high, by the way, is somewhere between the intensity of stomach acid and hydrochloric acid. That kind of acidic chemical running into our waters is enormously damaging.\",\n                \"Slide No. 4 is another depiction of exactly what happens when rainwater runs through these piles and finds its way into the streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes of Pennsylvania. It pollutes hundreds of miles of rivers and streams.\",\n                \"In 2007 former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell said:\",\n                \"These piles are domestic energy sources that have significant value when put into production in CFB cogeneration plants. When left on the ground, waste coal presents a grave environmental threat. Runoff from these piles contributes to the ``abandoned mine drainage'' that is the second leading water pollution problem in the Commonwealth, literally killing all life in some 2,000 stream miles in Pennsylvania.\",\n                \"But that is not all. Photo No. 5 shows something else that happens with these piles. They catch fire. They spontaneously combust. It could be from lightning, carelessness, and sometimes it is unknown, but they catch fire. This particular photo is from Fell Township in Lackawanna County, PA.\",\n                \"The pile caught fire in December of 2013. It burned for over a year. It is very hard to put these fires out. It burned out of control with, obviously, no ability to do anything about the pollutants that are being released by the combustion because it is completely uncontrolled.\",\n                \"We think the fire went out in January, but authorities are still not certain that it may not be smoldering somewhere below the surface. By the way, this mountain is 600 feet from residential housing. What is the effect of this kind of combustion on the residents in that area?\",\n                \"How much of this will burn? Maybe some people think this is just a freak incident. Not really, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that 6.6 million tons of waste coal burns each year--unintended, uncontrolled, but it is burning--and in the process it emits 9 million tons of carbon dioxide and many tons of other uncontrolled air pollution.\",\n                \"What about cleaning all of this up? The costs would be absolutely staggering. Again, former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary McGinty estimated that it costs between $20,000 and $40,000 to reclaim just one acre of waste coal. We have hundreds of thousands of acres of waste coal.\",\n                \"The Pennsylvania General Assembly has estimated it would cost approximately $15 billion to remediate Pennsylvania's abandoned mine set. That is the bad news.\",\n                \"The good news is the market has figured out a solution to address this matter. The free market has developed a way to systematically eliminate these mountains of waste coal, and for decades we have had powerplants designed specifically for the purpose of burning this coal and doing so in a controlled and regulated fashion. They have removed 210 million tons of waste coal and used it to produce electricity.\",\n                \"They have remediated over 8,000 acres. They have generated 1.769 gigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power 1.3 million homes, and in the process the generation of electricity from this waste coal has directly resulted in creating 1,200 jobs.\",\n                \"In the past, the EPA has always acknowledged the benefits of systematically eliminating these mountains of waste coal and doing so by generating electricity. In fact, I will quote a report from the EPA in 2011 that says this: ``Because of the unique environmental benefits that coal refuse-fired EGUs provide, these units warrant special consideration.''\",\n                \"The problem I am here to address is that there are two new rules passed by the EPA that would bring an end to the systemic elimination of these mountains because these rules are prohibitive. It is not possible for the waste coal powerplants to comply with these rules, so they would all be shut down and we would be left with these piles indefinitely, which would mar our landscape and pollute our water and air.\",\n                \"The two specific rules that would do this--the cross-State air pollution rule is very likely to have the effect of imposing absolutely unattainable goals on waste coal powerplants, and the utility MACT rule establishes new and very stringent emission controls and a whole new generation of very stringent regulations that this industry cannot meet.\",\n                \"If these rules go into effect--and they are scheduled to go into effect later this year--then waste coal and electric generation ends, and these plants close. As a result, we lose the electric power they have been generating, the 1,200 jobs they sustain, and the low-cost energy that is reliable and domestic. We will end up with a more serious air pollution problem when the spontaneous combustion continues, and we will have an ongoing problem with water and air pollution as the nearby streams and water table will be polluted.\",\n                \"That is why Senator Casey, Senator Hatch, and I have joined together to offer an amendment to this legislation that will exempt the waste coal powerplants from the most onerous and prohibitive aspects of these new rules.\",\n                \"With respect to utility MACT, we would retain all of the regulatory limits on mercury, chromium, nickel, and other heavy metals, but it would exempt the waste coal plants from the cross-State air pollution rules, and it would allow these plants to continue remediating these waste coal sites.\",\n                \"I wish to stress that it is important to point out that all of the existing regulations that have long been in effect will remain in effect. What we are talking about are the two new rules that would be guaranteed to shut down the industry. Those two rules would not go into effect with respect to the waste coal electric generation.\",\n                \"The fact is if our amendment is adopted and becomes law, we will be helping our environment by continuing to systematically eliminate these blights. I want more success stories like the one in this photograph.\",\n                \"This photo was taken in Nesquehoning in Carbon County, PA.

Kutztown, located in Berks County, Pennsylvania, was incorporated as a borough on April 7, 1815. Kutztown is the second oldest municipality in Berks County, after only the City of Reading. Kutztown's roots can be traced to the purchase of 130 acres of land made by Mr. George Kutz on June 16, 1755. In 1779 Mr. Kutz laid out plans to turn his acreage into a town and began selling lots. Like many communities founded during the 18th and 19th centuries, Kutztown was ideally situated along a key road, in this case, the Easton Road. The area served as a convenient lodging place for those making the then two-day trip between Allentown and Reading. Settled largely by people from the Palatinate region of Germany, an area bordering the Rhine River, Kutztown enjoyed growth and prosperity. The Borough's vibrant Germanic heritage remains an important part of the community and is on full display during the Kutztown Folk Festival. Over the years the Borough fostered numerous industries. The Borough gave rise to the Kutztown Iron Company, a brickyard, bottling companies, and even competing cigar companies. In 1866 the Borough saw the founding of the Keystone Normal School, the forerunner of Kutztown University. Today the University has an enrollment of nearly 9,500 students. Situated in the East Penn Valley, nestled between the Blue and South Mountains, the Borough of Kutztown and its people continue to thrive. Kutztown is an outstanding American town. Kutztown remains a great place to work, raise a family, to earn an education and to enjoy the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House and my colleagues, I congratulate the people of Kutztown on the occasion of the Borough's Bicentennial. God bless them and may they know continued prosperity.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/03/03/E292_honoring-the-borough-of-kutztowns-bicentennial/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"R\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-03-03\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"D000604\",\n            \"pages\": \"E292\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"Dent\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. dent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": \"MT\",\n            \"speaker_first\": \"Steve\",\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"EXECUTIVE SESSION\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-04-27/html/CREC-2015-04-27-pt1-PgS2427.htm\",\n            \"number\": 61,\n            \"order\": 8,\n            \"volume\": 161,\n            \"chamber\": \"Senate\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-04-27-pt1-PgS2427.chunk8\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \"Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm Dava Newman to be Deputy Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

It boasts 300 miles of breathtaking coastline--with rocky points, quiet inlets, and sandy beaches. This coastline alone brings in thousands of tourists each year who wish to share the marvels of our distinct and special home. This region also extends westward toward the White Mountains, an area dotted with numerous lakes, fertile lands, dense forests, and crossed by the mighty Saco River.

They have rallied local leaders and first responders to address the emergencies on the roads and made the veins of our economy safer through their Traffic Incident Management Group--which in 2007 was given the Excellence in Regional Transportation Award by the National Association of Development. Furthermore, with I-95 and Amtrak pouring resources and revenue into the State, SMPDC has been essential to coordinating community action to ensure we make the most of these assets.\",\n                \"And even while focusing on the largest arteries of transportation in the area, the commission has not turned a blind eye to the scenic roads and healthy travel alternatives that encourage people to get outdoors and reaffirms access and economic prospects for Maine's vibrant eco-tourism industry. Teaming up with the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, SMPDC has successfully implemented the York County Active Communities Network. This initiative explores the potential for improvements and funding opportunities for those looking to bike or walk safely and freely throughout their community. The group has also added further economic vitality to Maine through its work with the Pequawket Trail Scenic Byway, which winds its way through the White Mountains in western Maine and along the Saco River. This Corridor Management Plan floods the scenic towns along it with visitors and economic opportunity from downtown Standish to historic Fryeburg.\",\n                \"Perhaps what the commission is most widely recognized for is their success with the Brownfields Redevelopment Project, which is funded in part by the EPA's Brownfield and Land Revitalization Program. Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial properties that have some threat of environmental contamination, whether it is real or perceived. Beginning in 2004, the Brownfield Redevelopment Project started funding ventures throughout southern Maine to rebuild old dams, mills, and other previously condemned facilities to help reintroduce many of Maine's beautiful, historic buildings to their communities. South Berwick now boasts a fantastic renovated library and Kennebunk even retooled a gas station to create a community ice rink, while the mills in Sanford and Biddeford are teeming with hundreds of new businesses. At an event earlier in the year, the EPA cited SMPDC as one of the top 10 in the Nation for their wide ranging success with these projects. This work is truly exciting and a perfect demonstration of SMPDC's powerful impact on southern Maine.\",\n                \"As the Southern Maine Planning and Development Council ushers in their 50th anniversary on June 24, we should take time to reflect on the countless dedicated public servants who have worked with unwavering commitment to better their communities.

For thousands of years, the banks of the Androscoggin River and its tributaries were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. One of the legends that attests to the friendship that developed between the Native Americans and the first European settler concerns the Abenaki Princess Mollyocket, a woman with great spirit and knowledge of healing. A few years before the town was incorporated, she was called to the small settlement of Trap Corner to attend to a seriously ill infant. She nursed the baby back to health and pronounced that he would grow to greatness. Mollyocket's patient was Hannibal Hamlin, who became Abraham Lincoln's first Vice President.\",\n                \"Settlement began in 1787, when 10 lots of 100 acres each were surveyed. The early settlers at what was called The Thousand Acre Squadron were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. The wealth produced by the land and by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. In 1815, 5 years before Maine statehood, the settlers' petition for incorporation to the Governor of Massachusetts was readily signed, although, for reasons lost to history, he rejected the proposed name of Sparta and chose Woodstock instead.\",\n                \"The main population center of Woodstock is the Village of Bryant Pond, known for its beauty, recreation opportunities, and hospitality.

The attacks have displaced hundreds of families and sharpened Middle Eastern Christians' fears of the Islamic State, which considers non-Muslims, along with many Muslims who disagree with its tenets, infidels. The extremist group displaced entire Christian communities from northern Iraq when it swept through Mosul and the surrounding area last year. The new attacks came as some Christians in northeastern Syria, seeking to avoid the fate of northern Iraq's Christians and other minority sects like the Yazidis that were singled out by the Islamic State, had taken a more assertive role, fighting alongside Kurdish and other militias. The latest fighting took place in a string of villages along the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates. The central village, Tel Tamer, is a strategic crossroads, with a bridge over the river that connects northeastern Syria with the country's northern hub, Aleppo; residents reported that Islamic State militants bombed the bridge on Tuesday. The area has long been controlled by Kurdish militias but has lately come under attack from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In recent weeks, villages have changed hands several times as the Kurdish groups, some Arab Muslim factions and a Christian group called the Syriac Military Council have joined forces against the Islamic State. In the chaos Tuesday, the exact number of hostages seized remained unclear, with estimates ranging from several dozen to more than 100. Nuri Kino, an Assyrian-Swedish activist with family ties to northeastern Syria, said that Islamic State fighters were holding about 60 women and children in the village of Tel Shamiran, and that they had taken 90 men up into a mountainous area they control, perhaps seeking to exchange them for Islamic State prisoners. Mr. Kino, who founded A Demand for Action, a group that advocates for religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, said he had gleaned the information by talking to residents over Skype from Los Angeles. Dawoud Dawoud, the deputy president of the Assyrian Democratic Party in the area, reached in Hasaka, said that the villages had long been largely left alone, but that in early February, Islamic State fighters had demanded that crosses be removed from churches. The jihadists raided the village of Tel Hermez, driving away a local group, the Guardians of Khabur, that had protected churches there, said Omar Abd al-Aziz, a local antigovernment activist who uses a nom de guerre for his safety. Called to help, Kurdish militias entered the town with fighters from the Syriac Military Council, who filmed themselves retaking the area and leading away bound men they said were Islamic State members. Now, the Islamic State appears to be retaliating with even greater numbers and heavy weapons. ``It's the new Kobani,'' said Mr. Kino, referring to the Kurdish enclave bordering Turkey whose encirclement by the Islamic State prompted American-led airstrikes that helped drive the group back. He called for United States intervention to prevent massacres and displacements. The threats to minority enclaves, as in Kobani and the attacks on Yazidis in Iraq's Sinjar mountains last summer, have galvanized international action when other fighting did not. Another activist in the area, who gave only his first name, Siraj, because of concern for his safety, accused the Kurds of leaving the Assyrians vulnerable in order to provoke a Kobani-like international reaction. But Nawaf al-Khalil, a spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Union, a political party, tried to find a bright side, saying the events were ``a good sign of stronger ties between the Kurds, the Arabs and the Christians'' against the Islamic State.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/02/25/S1090-4_department-of-homeland-security-appropriations-act/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": null,\n            \"date\": \"2015-02-25\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": null,\n            \"pages\": \"S1090-S1099\",\n            \"speaker_last\": null,\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"recorder\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": \"WV\",\n            \"speaker_first\": \"Shelley\",\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-03-12/html/CREC-2015-03-12-pt1-PgS1491.htm\",\n            \"number\": 42,\n            \"order\": 0,\n            \"volume\": 161,\n            \"chamber\": \"Senate\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-03-12-pt1-PgS1491.chunk0\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \"Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of legislation to create the Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC.\",\n                \"In the decade of the 1960s, intense poverty and economic struggle characterized the existence for many people and towns running down the spine of the Appalachian Mountains.

That was the basis for the 1986 legislation I initiated to create a national park in Nevada. The only national park we have in Nevada is the result of the 1922 action of President Harding. That is why we have Great Basin National Park. It is a wonderful facility. It has a glacier, the oldest living things in the world, the bristlecone pines. It is a great park, and people from all over the world visit this wonderful facility.

I have been to all of them, and even though Utah is an extremely conservative State, I have not heard one single Member of Congress or governmental authority say they were a huge mistake.

You see, it was February, and there was a labor dispute. There was a shutdown on our ports on the West Coast. So as the plane descended, instead of seeing the beaches stretched throughout California or the Santa Monica mountains, my attention was drawn to the number of ships sitting idle in the ocean and the number of ships that were just sitting in the port. You see, the docks were shut down and our economy was halted. \",\n                \"When Americans cannot have their products moved to willing buyers, the men and women who are part of the creation do not receive the rewards of their efforts. And in California, we cannot afford to waste any of our resources, especially what we have a short supply of--water. So when the trade was shut down, the food that was produced throughout the Central Valley would just rot on the docks.\",\n                \"But what was most interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, I remember a phone call I got just another weekend after. It was the president of the Republican freshman class here. He had just done a town hall, and he is from Colorado. He said: Mr. Leader, I have got a big issue in Colorado. The ports of the West Coast are shut down. You see, my small businesses are hurt by that. They are hurt when we are not able to have trade.\",\n                \"I remember a big bipartisan press conference we had, Republicans and Democrats alike, the largest one I have ever been a part of in the press room, talking about the ports being shut down, because every single one of their districts were affected, especially the small businesses.\",\n                \"When we cannot trade, our economy suffers and our way of life suffers. In fact, during that same period of this crippling shutdown, our economy actually shrank.\",\n                \"Today, what we are talking about on the floor is trade promotion authority. It allows us to get to an agreement. You know, we have not had it for a few years.\",\n                \"So what has happened around the world while the rest of America sat idle? There have been 100 trade agreements; 100 trade agreements around the world that we would want more of our small businesses to be a part of. You know how many we were a part of during that time? Zero, because we did not have TPA.\",\n                \"You know, trade is the difference between rotting produce on the harbor docks and sending California goods around the world. Trade is the difference between the lines of prosperity and the lines of stagnation.\",\n                \"We have a unique opportunity today. It is not a trade agreement. It is an opportunity. It is an opportunity that will empower each and every Member of this floor to have input, to have transparency, but what is more important, to empower every single American to make sure they are now at the table, that when there is the next trade agreement between countries who want to engage, America won't be left out, America can lead once more.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/06/12/H4271_america-gives-more-act-of-2015/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"R\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-06-12\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"M001165\",\n            \"pages\": \"H4271-H4333\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"McCarthy\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. mccarthy\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": \"MA\",\n            \"speaker_first\": \"Jim\",\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"WORLD IS SILENT AS SUDAN RENEWS GENOCIDAL ATTACKS\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-02-11/html/CREC-2015-02-11-pt1-PgH923.htm\",\n            \"number\": 23,\n            \"order\": 1,\n            \"volume\": 161,\n            \"chamber\": \"House\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-02-11-pt1-PgH923.chunk1\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation inside Sudan.

Attackers have forced women, children, and the elderly to leave their villages with nothing to survive on, often looting everything belonging to civilians.\",\n                \"It is clear that the RSF and their masters in Khartoum are engaged in a campaign to strip the people of Darfur of everything they own, anything that might keep them alive, and condemn them to increasing poverty displacement, starvation, and death.

Security Council--remains silent.\",\n                \"In the border states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, defenseless civilians in the Nuba Mountains face a relentless bombing campaign by the Sudanese Air Force and ground attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces.

At the end of this month, I intend to reintroduce an updated version of my bipartisan bill, the Sudan Peace, Security, and Accountability Act, and demonstrate to the suffering people of Sudan--especially those in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile--that we hear their cries and that this House intends to take action.\",\n                \"I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort.\",\n                \"Sudan's impunity and intransigence have taken a sharp turn for the worse. That's a pretty high bar considering the country's track record since the genocide in Darfur started more than a decade ago. But even measured against a long history of abuse, Sudan's recent actions led by President Omar al-Bashir are a particularly harsh slap in the face for the international community. In recent weeks, the Government of Sudan has newly bombed civilians in Darfur and the Nuba Mountains, blocked the investigation of a reported mass rape of over 200 Darfuri women, and, in the midst of the sharpest increase in violence and displacement in years, called for the removal of UN peacekeepers. These new bold actions must be met with equally bold measures by the United States and the rest of the international community. The facts are astounding. More than 430,000 people newly displaced in Darfur in 2014, the highest number since the height of the genocide. Over 2,000 bombs dropped in South Kordofan and Blue Nile since fighting began there in 2012. And new bombings in Darfur are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions. ``Increased criminality'' and ``prevailing insecurity'' cited in the latest report of the UN Secretary General on Darfur including fifty-five cases of violence, nearly half by government forces, in recorded by UN peacekeepers in the last 90 days. Serious allegations of mass rape that the UN Secretary General and highest UN peacekeeping officials have insisted must be investigated. Yet, the Sudanese government is blatant in its denial. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted on charges of genocide by the International Criminal Court, accused the UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) of being a ``security burden'' and blamed foreigners for fabricating rape allegations to ``confuse the improvement of the situation in Darfur''. To make matters worse, this is not just an escalation of the kind of posturing the Sudanese regime has practiced in the past. Bashir is also getting new support from Russia. In a recent visit, the Russian Foreign Minister announced plans for increased military support for the Sudanese regime and the Sudanese government said that Russia supports its position on removal of UNAMID. The irony is that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia is among those responsible for failing to support UNAMID. On paper, the Council has given UNAMID a strong mandate, backed by the strongest authorizations under Chapter VII of the UN Charter including the use of force to protect civilians. But in reality, Sudan has been allowed to intimidate UNAMID and there has been little accountability from the international community when the mission fails to report or act to protect civilians. The way to address these problems is not play into the hands of the perpetrators and to remove the imperfect last line of defense for many civilians, but rather to reinforce the peacekeeping mission so that it can carry out the mission that has been set out for it. The UN Security Council, including Russia, must live up to its own commitments in terms of justice and accountability. The year 2014 will close with the latest briefing of the UN Security Council on Darfur by the Chief Prosecutor to the International Criminal Court (ICC) Fatou Bensouda. Amazingly, this is the 20th such briefing since the Council referred the case of Darfur to the ICC. In her last such briefing, Bensouda admonished the Security Council for its failure to take action in the face of ``total impunity'' in Darfur and called for ``a dramatic shift in this Council's approach to arresting Darfur suspects''. Six months later little has been done to support the court. Sadly, the only dramatic shift has come on the part of the Government of Sudan whose latest intransigence is mind- bogglingly being met with more welcome than condemnation. For the sake of past victims of genocide and those now in the cross-hairs of the sharpest uptick in violence in nearly a decade, the Security Council must respond. Dear Madam, Dear Sir, Dear Colleague, Please find below a statement released today by Doctors Without Borders/Meedecins Sans Frontieeres (MSF) regarding the aerial bombing of a hospital operated by MSF in Sudan on January 20, forcing the suspension of medical activities.

Thus, building this pipeline is a mistake, and there is a lot to be concerned about.\",\n                \"Now, global warming isn't some imaginary scenario 50 years from now about some computer model predicting something bad will happen. No, it is about facts on the ground right now.\",\n                \"The warmest 10 years on record for global average surface temperature have occurred in the last 12 years. And 2014, the calendar year we just passed, was the single warmest year on record. While some Senators may come to this floor and say that it is just an anomaly here or an anomaly there, it is not. The facts are in. When we have 10 of the warmest years on record within the last 12 years, we know something dramatically is happening to the globe.\",\n                \"The average forest fire season is getting longer. Since the 1980s the season has grown 60 to 80 days longer than it was before. That means that with each year passing the fire season is growing by an average of about 2 days, and the number of acres consumed annually by wildfires has doubled to more than 7 million acres. This is an enormous impact, and those fires themselves put additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So we start to see a feedback mechanism that is accelerating us down this road to catastrophic change.\",\n                \"The snowpack is decreasing in our Oregon mountains, the Cascade Mountains, which means smaller and warmer streams, which are certainly not good for trout. But it also means less water for irrigation. We have right now virtually no snow in the Cascades. At this point we should have a substantial snowpack. So the possibility of yet another major drought faces us this coming summer.\",\n                \"We had the worst-ever drought in the Klamath Basin, a large agricultural basin in southern Oregon, in 2001.

If you think putting all that acid into the ocean wouldn't be a good idea and would have bad effects, you are right. The ocean has become 30 percent more acidic than it was before the industrial revolution--before we started burning coal and other fossil fuels as a major source of energy--and we can start to see the impact.\",\n                \"At the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery on the Oregon coast, we have a big problem. The big problem is that the baby oysters are having trouble pulling enough carbon out of the water in order to create their shells because the water is too acidic.

But here is the problem: If we wait to tackle global warming until--we have pages on the floor--our 15- and 16-year-old pages are in office, when they are in their forties and their fifties, then it will be almost impossible to address this issue because of the feedback loops that are occurring.\",\n                \"I was watching yesterday a time-lapsed series of ice in the Arctic, and I can tell you that essentially, as viewed from North America, there was a swirling mass of ice--and this was over several decades--and that swirling mass became less with every passing year, to where we are halfway to starting to be ice-free in the summer. That is a massive change happening within a single human lifetime which is but a blink in time when you think about the age and course of this planet.\",\n                \"So big changes are occurring, and when those changes occur, we do have additional problems arise. All of that open water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight. That is what makes the water blue and it becomes warmer; whereas, the ice reflects the sunlight and keeps the water cooler. Therefore, we have a magnification of the effect of global warming at the poles. This is not a good thing.\",\n                \"So whether we are looking at the impact on our farming or the impact on our forests which are burning or the impact on our oceans and our fisheries which are becoming too acidic, we have a responsibility to address those issues.

We have to leave it in the ground rather than burn it if we are not going to exceed 2 degrees centigrade in global warming.

Tom Perry, an exemplary leader whose kindness, compassion, and love were as boundless as his optimism. Elder Perry quietly passed away on May 30 after a brief battle with thyroid cancer. Serving as an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than 40 years, Elder Perry traveled the world, strengthening congregations, visiting the poor, and ministering to the sick and afflicted. Throughout his ecclesiastical service, his words and actions inspired countless Latter-day Saints and many more outside the church. As millions across the world mourn his passing, we find peace in his teachings and take solace in the memory of a man who consecrated his life to the service of others.\",\n                \"From humble beginnings, Elder Perry developed a strong sense of discipline that would later define his church service. Born to Leslie Thomas and Nora Sonne Perry in 1922, his father was a lawyer and his mother was a teacher by profession. Together, they taught Tom the principles of honest work and self-reliance. Elder Perry was no stranger to hard labor, and some of his earliest memories included long days working the fields, milking the family cow, and cutting hay by hand with an old scythe. From these early experiences, Elder Perry learned that nothing would be handed to him and that he had to work for everything he received. And work he did.\",\n                \"After finishing his first year of college, Elder Perry accepted a call to serve his church in the Northern States Mission. During the 2 years Elder Perry worked as a volunteer missionary, he developed a powerful testimony of Jesus Christ--a testimony that inspired a life of love and selfless service. After serving his church, Elder Perry desired to serve his country. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps only a month after returning from his church mission.\",\n                \"Elder Perry's marine battalion was deployed to Nagasaki shortly after the Japanese surrender. Observing the devastation and suffering of the Japanese people only softened Elder Perry's already tender heart. In his off-duty hours, he rallied a group of fellow marines to help him rebuild a Protestant chapel. On the same tour, he also helped repair a Catholic orphanage and build another chapel on the island of Saipan. While in Japan, Elder Perry grew especially close to a Protestant congregation. When he was transferred to another city, a group of nearly 200 members of this congregation gathered to bid him farewell. As his train crawled out of the station, each member of the congregation lined up along the track as Elder Perry reached out to touch their hands one by one. He loved these people, and they loved him back, making the goodbye all the more difficult. Last Saturday, thousands of us tasted that same bittersweet emotion when Elder Perry departed this mortal life for the next. Like this small Japanese congregation, we were all moved by his kindness, energized by his enthusiasm, and humbled by his service. \",\n                \"After his honorable release from the Marine Corps, Elder Perry returned to Utah State University, where he earned a degree in finance and married his wife, Virginia Lee. Together, they were the parents of three children: Barbara, Linda Gay, and Lee. Family was always the highest priority for Elder Perry. Although his successful business career demanded much of his attention, he always made special sacrifices to spend time with his wife and children.\",\n                \"Elder Perry was also committed to balancing his busy work schedule with his church service. As his family moved across the country--from Idaho and California, to New York and Boston--Elder Perry served in various leadership positions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including two bishoprics, a high council, and two stake presidencies. In April 1974, he accepted a calling to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Sadly, after serving as an apostle for only 8 months, Elder Perry's beloved wife, Virginia Lee, died of cancer. Nine years later, cancer would also take his daughter, Barbara. Although Elder Perry's life was marked by tragedy, it was not defined by it. His faith in God was unshakeable, as was his optimism. In response to heartbreak, Elder Perry said, ``[The Lord] is very kind. Even though some experiences are hard, he floods your mind with memories and gives you other opportunities. Life doesn't end just because you have a tragedy--there's a new mountain to climb.''\",\n                \"Elder Perry never stopped climbing those mountains, and he served valiantly as an Apostle of Jesus Christ. In 1976, he married Barbara Dayton--his loving helpmeet and able partner who helped him bear the heavy responsibility of his apostolic calling. I will always remember Elder Perry for the zeal and energy he brought to every facet of his life. Nothing could temper his enthusiasm, and nothing could deter him from doing what was right.\",\n                \"Elder Perry never tired of his calling. He so loved meeting with church members and leaders throughout the world that he once said, ``My association with great men has been not only an education, but an inspiration.'' I can easily say the same of my own association with Elder Perry; it has been both an education and an inspiration, and I will always be grateful for his example.\",\n                \"I will never forget Elder Perry, his life of dedicated service, and his unwavering optimism. I consider myself lucky to have known him and even luckier to call him a friend. I will miss Elder Perry dearly, as will all those who knew him. I send my deepest condolences to his wife, Barbara, and their beautiful family. May God comfort them in this time of grief, and may his love be with them always.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/06/04/S3770-2_remembering-elder-l-tom-perry/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"R\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-06-04\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"H000338\",\n            \"pages\": \"S3770-S3771\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"Hatch\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. hatch\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": \"UT\",\n            \"speaker_first\": \"Orrin\",\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"CLOTURE MOTION\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-06-23/html/CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4525.htm\",\n            \"number\": 101,\n            \"order\": 3,\n            \"volume\": 161,\n            \"chamber\": \"Senate\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4525.chunk3\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \"In other words, we know we can compete on the world stage when the rules are fair and the playing field is level.

I understand TAA is a priority for a number of my colleagues and that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to support TPA.

He had surgery, then he made a full recovery, and was soon back to work.\",\n                \"In 2006 we were all shocked to learn that Senator Johnson suffered a brain hemorrhage--and for weeks we hoped and prayed for him and his family.

That is a Senator with a deep appreciation for the privilege of serving the people of South Dakota. That is Tim Johnson\",\n                \"Despite the personal health issues Senator Johnson experienced, he succeeded in leading passage of the Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of 2005, a law that 3 years later was critical to keeping America's deposits safe during a time of great economic turmoil. As chair of the Senate banking committee we have relied on his leadership and judgment in reducing risk in the financial sector and in ensuring that Dodd-Frank reforms were implemented effectively.\",\n                \"I will miss our work together to improve the health care of American veterans, and I will miss the opportunity I have had through the years to work with Senator Johnson on empowering small family farms to compete in the modern marketplace and to help ethanol producers expand their place in our Nation's renewable energy future.\",\n                \"Knowing how important it was for ranchers to be able to tell consumers their meat products came from the U.S.A., Senator Johnson has been a champion of country of origin labeling since going back to the 2002 farm bill, and since then he has helped to strengthen and fully implement the law, a mission that carried over to the 2014 farm bill that I authored as chair of the agriculture committee.\",\n                \"In addition, Senator Johnson has been a forceful advocate for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration rules that ensure that family farmers and ranchers are able to compete on a level playing field.\",\n                \"I know how much Senator Johnson has loved policymaking, so I know he must have agonized over this decision.

I don't think it is possible to overstate the magnitude of the challenges that she has faced on behalf of her constituents. Hurricane Katrina may have been the most horrible natural disaster our country has ever experienced--and Senator Landrieu's native city of New Orleans was ground zero.\",\n                \"No one was more engaged in the recovery effort that followed that calamity. Senator Landrieu fought tenaciously to secure the funds it would take to repair and revitalize the gulf coast with infrastructure improvements that would protect the coast against another major event.\",\n                \"In the 10 years since Katrina, Senator Landrieu has been a champion for homeowners who were struggling to afford flood insurance, most recently by winning passage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, this past March.\",\n                \"Of course, just as the gulf coast appeared close to making a full recovery, it was struck by another disaster--the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. Again, Senator Landrieu was on the vanguard of that recovery, winning passage of the RESTORE Act so that the vast majority of the fines collected by the U.S. Government would go back to the gulf coast to help pay for the cleanup. It is the single biggest investment in environmental restoration in American history.\",\n                \"These were the moments when the people of Louisiana needed Mary Landrieu most--and she delivered as only she can.\",\n                \"At the same time, Senator Landrieu has always understood that the oil and gas industry is vital to her State's economy, and so it was a major milestone when she became the first woman to chair the Senate energy committee. She fights so hard for Louisiana, but over the years of working with her, I have learned how much she is driven by a deep feeling of compassion, not just for those displaced by hurricanes or those whose livelihood was jeopardized by the Deepwater Horizon but for the children of her State and our country who were given up for adoption or placed in foster care. Senator Landrieu knows the joys of adopting firsthand, having adopted her two children, Connor and Mary Shannon, and she wants other parents to feel that joy. So she sympathizes with parents who wish to adopt a child but who are struggling to do so--especially since she knows there are children desperate for parents but who remain wards of the State. By matching those parents with that child, she knows that she can create a true family.\",\n                \"So she has led the efforts in the Senate to improve child welfare systems internationally and to make it easier for American parents to adopt children in other countries. She has pushed for Federal funds to create foster care mentoring programs, so that children who are in the foster system have better guidance during the most critical years of their social development. I know I speak for other Members of this Chamber when I say that we will do our very best to continue the momentum that Senator Landrieu has created for finding a permanent, loving home for every American child. I will deeply miss having her with us but I have absolutely no doubt that Mary Landrieu will find new ways to express her devotion to the people of Louisiana and our country. It is not just a tradition in her family; it is her singular passion. I thank her for her amazing service here and I look forward to all the great achievements that are in her future.\",\n                \"Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to a dear colleague and friend who has been a champion for our national parks and for preserving the natural splendor of our Western lands: Senator Mark Udall. Just as the Great Lakes are part of my DNA, the Rocky Mountains are part of Senator Udall's. He likes to quote the saying that we did not inherit this earth from our parents but that we are borrowing it from our children--and that is the perspective that has guided him as Chair of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee. He has worked to expand national parks and to revitalize our natural resources. Recognizing that our dependence on fossil fuels poses a threat to our land, water and wildlife, Senator Udall has been a leader in pushing for investments in renewable energy. I know how proud he was that Colorado was the first State to pass a voter-approved renewable energy policy. A key to making it happen was Senator Udall teaming up in a bipartisan way with the speaker of the Colorado House. When Colorado was struck by floods, forest fires, and beetle infestations, Senator Udall fought to make sure the State had the Federal resources to contain the damage and aid the recovery. We learn a lot about our leaders during a time of crisis, and time and again, Senator Udall has proven the strength of his character and his convictions. In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, CO, Senator Udall threw his support behind a ban on combat weapons, as well as an amendment to expand background searches for gun purchases. It was a bold position to take politically, but the Udall family has a long tradition of taking bold positions whose wisdom is borne out by history: His grandfather issued a court decision that recognized Native Americans' right to vote; his uncle challenged discrimination by Washington's football team; and his father helped integrate the University of Arizona. It is fitting that in Senator Udall's last full week with the Senate he gave a stirring speech on the floor, demanding transparency in the way that our Nation treats suspected terrorists. Senator Udall has also been one of the Senate's most vocal advocates for civil liberties, arguing passionately that our government's conduct must always respect both our values and the Constitution. Personally, I have had the honor of working alongside Senator Udall as co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson's Disease, teaming up on behalf of the National MS and Parkinson's Disease Registries Act. This past month we joined forces on an amendment that ensures women in the military will have access to quality health services, with a specific focus on maternity and preventive care. I will miss our talks and our collaborations. But leaving the Senate will allow Senator Udall to become an even more avid outdoorsman. While he has already climbed Mt. Everest and the 100 tallest peaks in his home State of Colorado, I have no doubt that he will soon conquer new and exciting challenges in the great outdoors. And from listening to his farewell address, it is already apparent to me that Senator Udall has achieved a clarity that will serve him forever after. ``As a lifelong mountain climber,'' he said, ``I have learned far more from the mountains I did not summit, than those that I did.'' I know I speak for many of us here when I say that I have learned a great deal from Senator Udall, and I thank him for serving Colorado and our Nation in the U.S. Senate--and for being a great friend. Happy trails, Senator.\",\n                \"Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to my dear friend and colleague, Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina.\",\n                \"Kay Hagan has quite a collection of hats. There is the hat she wore as a lawyer in Greensboro. She wore one hat as a banker, another as a State legislator helping to write North Carolina's State budget. And when she excelled in each of these roles, the voters of North Carolina gave her another hat to wear, as their U.S. Senator.\",\n                \"Kay Hagan joined us in January 2009, which was a difficult time for our Nation's economy. With her background in the banking sector and her knowledge of the housing finance system, she got right to work on rebuilding our economy, with a stronger foundation.\",\n                \"At the same time, she never allowed herself to be distracted from the needs specific to her North Carolina constituents. She recognized that North Carolina workers and small businesses were being threatened by unfair trade practices abroad, and she sought to address it.\",\n                \"She recognizes how vital military bases are to North Carolina's economy and to its culture, so she worked to protect them from cuts and closures. She was a leader for military families who care for disabled children, seeking to provide payments for them from the Survivor Benefit Plan. And it was Senator Hagan who stepped up to help families at Camp Lejeune get access to health care, following one of the worst cases of water contamination in American history.\",\n                \"With two daughters of her own, Senator Hagan knows about the demands of balancing child care with a career, and as Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families, she called attention to the need for paid leave. Senator Hagan and I share important health care priorities: She cosponsored a bill to improve the care of mothers and babies by establishing higher quality standards for maternity care through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. And she has been a valuable ally on the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, which would help doctors detect this disease earlier and provide more support for those taking care of a family member with Alzheimer's.\",\n                \"I had the distinct honor of teaming up with Senator Hagan earlier this year to help pork farmers get disaster assistance after a deadly virus devastated their livestock. And we worked together to sound the alarm on student loan debt and to try to stop interest rates on Federal loans from rising. We both come from States where hunting, fishing, and wildlife are important components to residents' quality of life.

At the outset this Senator wants to say the conclusion of this Senator is that this is much more about politics than it is about energy policy, than it is about the economy of this country, particularly so since the price of oil has gone from something in excess of $100 a barrel down to the range of $46 a barrel.\",\n                \"Likewise, the fact that the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world--in large part because of our brethren and sistren in the Senate who represent those Northern Plains States as well as the Southwestern States where they are producing all of this newly found oil from the shale rock which has strengthened the economic position of our country. Think about it, No. 1 producer in the world. That is us. As a result, we do not have to be nearly as dependent on the Middle East, from where we used to get at least 50, 60 percent of our oil or from other areas such as Nigeria or Venezuela.\",\n                \"I have just mentioned three very unstable parts of the world. Yet that is the position we have been in, but that has changed. It is now the 21st century. As a result of new technologies, we are the No. 1 producer of oil in the world. So back when we were not, when we were still dependent on foreign oil, there was a discovery in Canada--Western Canada--the ability to extract oil from the heavy tar in these tar sands.\",\n                \"The Canadians wanted an outlet for that. It made it much more appealing to us, to the United States back then, when oil was over $100 a barrel and we were still importing a lot of it from abroad. But interestingly, the Canadians wanted and suggested a pipeline that would come right through the middle of the United States, from the north in Canada, through the middle of the United States, down to the gulf coast, to the refineries.\",\n                \"Why didn't they go west from the western States of Canada to the Pacific to have an outlet? They had to cross the Rocky Mountains. Of course that was going to be expensive. It was also going to roil up a bunch of the Canadian environmentalists. So the idea of the Keystone XL was born.\",\n                \"What does XL stand for? Extra large. Well, if it was extra large, it implies there is an existing pipeline. Indeed there is. I want to show it to you. This orange line is an existing pipeline coming from Alberta, northeast of Calgary, across Saskatchewan into Manitoba, and then it comes down through North Dakota, South Dakota, eastern Nebraska, and there it forks right at the Kansas line. One line goes east all the way into Illinois, and the other line goes south through Kansas into Oklahoma.\",\n                \"I said at the outset this is much more about politics as opposed to energy policy, as well as economics because this all heated up--XL, extra large--during the last Presidential election. Of course those who raise this issue were trying to say: Unless you embrace this XL you are against the United States being energy independent.\",\n                \"Well, an interesting thing happened along the way. From Cushing, OK, there was no line directly going to the gulf coast, where the refineries are in Houston and Port Arthur. The President approved that. That has been constructed. I am advised that has just opened in the last few days--so the existing line, all the way from Alberta, Canada, through the heartland of America, all the way to the gulf coast. That is that.\",\n                \"But XL, extra large, to carry more oil, was proposed. The route that is now proposed is here. That looks like it makes sense because it cuts off the dogleg and does a straight line. But originally it had come much further to the west, right over the environmentally sensitive lands of the aquifer in central Nebraska where so much of the water resources for the entire Midwestern United States come from.\",\n                \"This Senator said, back in the Presidential election of 2012: If you really want a bigger pipeline and you want to avoid all of the controversy over the environment, which this proposed route certainly has since it is extra large, why do you not just run it along the existing pipeline? The right of way is already there. Indeed, it is now complete all the way to the gulf coast. Why do you not run it just right along and you would have a lot less opposition?\",\n                \"But no. This Senator comes back to his main point: This is all about politics. It is all about trying to make some look as though they are anti-energy and others look as though they are pro-energy. But it is what it is. It is 2 years later, and here we are.\",\n                \"The proposal is to still come across parts of Montana, South Dakota, further east in Nebraska, and join with the existing pipeline. So what is confronting a Senator such as this who certainly wants us to be energy independent? Well, then, if we are going to have additional oil supplies as a backup, maybe that would be a good consideration. So let's make sure this new source of foreign oil--that we have a chance to use it in this country, since it is going to come right down the middle of America.\",\n                \"No. No. No can do. This foreign oil, for those who are proposing what we are about to vote on, is going right down the gullet of America, right down the middle of America to the gulf coast, and it is going to be exported to foreign countries. So a little old country boy such as I wonders: Now, wait. Let me get this straight. You want foreign oil to build a big oil pipeline to run right through the middle of America as a conduit to send right out to other foreign countries and not be utilized in this country?\",\n                \"Sadly, the answer to that is yes. That is what we are confronting. We had an amendment that Canada could not export it. We could use it here for American purposes.

Under his leadership, the Marine Safety Office Houston-Galveston developed integrated tactics, techniques, and procedures to ensure the safety of the ports under its purview. In the years immediately following 9/11, Rear Admiral Cook directed homeland security operations while commanding the Regional Task Unit covering waters from Freeport, TX, to Lake Charles, LA. He carefully balanced safety and security with the need to facilitate commerce in the largest petrochemical complex in the United States.

His work established the foundation for Coast Guard maritime security operations today.\",\n                \"Rear Admiral Cook also spent time developing policy for the Coast Guard and the international maritime community. He was an engineer for, and later the Chief of, the Coast Guard's hazardous materials division.

During this tour, our Nation would once again need Rear Admiral Cook's leadership and, as before, he would answer that call, serving as the national incident commander's representative to BP headquarters for oversight of well containment activities during the 2010 Deep Water Horizon response. His specialty knowledge and incident response expertise was instrumental to the management of the first-ever designated Spill of National Significance, SONS, in U.S. history.\",\n                \"Rear Admiral Cook later served as deputy commander of the Atlantic area in Portsmouth, VA, overseeing operations spanning five Coast Guard districts and 40 States, from the Rocky Mountains to the Arabian Gulf.\",\n                \"Rear Admiral Cook presently serves as the commander of the Eighth Coast Guard District.

In fact, the Eighth District oversees 17 of the top 40 busiest U.S. ports in terms of gross tonnage shipped annually--ports such as Houston, Lake Charles, Corpus Christi, New Orleans, and Mobile that are vital to our Nation's economic prosperity. The Eighth District's boundaries also contain the majority of our Nation's river systems, which facilitate the movement of 880 million tons of cargo annually via towboat and barge traffic.

I met Glenn Landers, a senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Everglades Division. He has worked on water resources and restoration projects in Florida for nearly 20 years. This is the map he used to show me what just 2 feet of sea level rise would mean for South Florida. There is a lot less of it.\",\n                \"Like New York, they have measured almost 1 foot of sea level rise in South Florida in the last 100 years. And like New York, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact--which is a bipartisan coalition of four South Florida counties--once we get away from this building, it turns out this can actually be a bipartisan issue; that cloud of special interest money that wraps the Congress isn't as apparent when you get to Florida counties. That bipartisan coalition predicts, like New York, again, continued sea level rise. Indeed, the waters around southeast Florida could surge up to another 2 feet in less than 50 years. As we can see, most of the iconic Everglades--which is the largest tract of wilderness east of the Rocky Mountains and home to some of the most rare and endangered species in America--will be under seawater.\",\n                \"Now, there is some resemblance between New York and Florida in the threat of sea level rise. But the resemblance to New York diverges when we look at some of the unique features of the Florida peninsula.\",\n                \"First is its low elevation. Miami is just 6 feet above sea level. Six feet of sea level rise goes a long way.\",\n                \"Second, southern Florida, as the Army Corps of Engineers constantly attests, rests on porous limestone. In New York, levees and dams can be built that will hold the ocean back. They can fortify New York City and wall it in like Holland. In Miami, they would be building those structures on a geological sponge. The rising water will just seep right under. And even in the higher areas that might still stay dry, saltwater will infiltrate the underground drinking water.\",\n                \"Of all the people and all the homes in the Nation at risk from rising seas, an estimated 40 percent are in the State of Florida.

That legislation was Congress responding to scandal within the Department of Veterans Affairs--the fraudulent wait lists, the lack of services available to veterans who were waiting, and a number of veterans falling through the cracks. Congress responded and passed legislation now referred to as the choice act.\",\n                \"What that choice act said in simple terms is that if you are a veteran and you are unable to receive the services you need from the Department of Veterans Affairs within 30 days or if you are a veteran who lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility, the choice act allows you--in fact, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide you with services at home if you so choose. It is your choice.\",\n                \"That bill was passed by Congress in August of 2014, signed by the President in September, implemented since then beginning in November, and it is now March of 2015. What we have discovered during that period of implementation is there are a number of pitfalls by which veterans are not receiving the care we indicated they would receive following the passage of that legislation. A lot of that problem is related to the 40-mile provision. Again, if you live more than 40 miles from a VA facility, the law says the Department of Veterans Affairs will provide you with service, if you so choose, with a local provider.\",\n                \"A couple of things have happened. The interpretation by the Department of Veterans Affairs of a couple of provisions has precluded a significant number, in my view, of veterans from being able to utilize this choice program.\",\n                \"Yesterday, the Department of Veterans Affairs, to their own credit, decided that they had been interpreting the law incorrectly. That provision related to as the crow flies, meaning that the 40 miles was to be computed as the crow flies, and that was the way the VA determined they were required to interpret that provision. Yesterday, the Department of Veterans Affairs decided they had the authority to really make that 40 miles highway miles. So if you happen to live on one side of a lake or one side of a mountain, it is no longer as the crow flies. That is a piece of good news.\",\n                \"But here is the issue I have raised numerous times, and here is the issue that still remains a problem for many veterans. I smile when I say this because there are not many lakes in Kansas and there are no mountains in Kansas, so ``as the crow flies'' is not a significant issue to most Kansans as it is in many other places in the country. But yesterday's decision by the Department does increase the number of veterans who may qualify for the choice act.\",\n                \"Among other things, what is still missing is the idea of a facility within 40 miles. The problem is this: The Department of Veterans Affairs has interpreted and continues to interpret that to mean even though there is a VA facility within the 40 miles that does not provide the service the veteran needs, it is still a facility within 40 miles, and thus the veteran will be required to transport themselves to a hospital 2, 3, 4 hours away.\",\n                \"I have said this before on the Senate floor. As a House Member before coming to the Senate, I represented a congressional district made up of tens of thousands of square miles, larger than the State of Illinois. There is no VA hospital within that congressional district. We worked hard to create outpatient clinics where routine services could be provided closer to home for those veterans. Now we are saying: If you can't access the care that is more than 40 miles from your home, the VA is going to give you the option of seeing your hometown doctor, being admitted to your hometown hospital. But here is one of the problems: If there is an outpatient clinic within that 40 miles, even though it doesn't provide the service you as a veteran need, the VA says you don't qualify for the choice act.\",\n                \"I am of the view that they have the ability to interpret that law differently. They say it takes a legislative change. I am not sure there is a lot of value in continuing to have the debate about who is right about that. What I do know is there are many veterans in Kansas and across the country who are not receiving the services promised by the choice act because there is an outpatient clinic within the 40 miles, but it doesn't provide the service they need.\",\n                \"To give folks an understanding of what I am talking about, most outpatient clinics don't provide colonoscopies. So we have a veteran who needs a colonoscopy. The VA is to provide that service. Yet, in the case of where I come from, my hometown, the VA hospital is 3 hours away and the outpatient clinic is half an hour away, and because there is an outpatient clinic half an hour away, that veteran can't utilize the choice act. But the outpatient clinic doesn't provide colonoscopies, so that veteran is told by the VA that he or she has to drive the 3 hours to the hospital in Wichita to get the colonoscopy. Well, there is a community hospital within that area, within that veteran's hometown that provides colonoscopy.\",\n                \"That situation is what the choice act was designed to accomplish--service provided at home. So this amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund that requires the VA to utilize its current authorities to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where they live because the facility they have won't or can't provide the services they need. \",\n                \"This is something we ought to be able to resolve. This amendment is widely supported.\",\n                \"There is legislation--S. 207--which I have introduced and which has many cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, and we will continue to push this legislation. In fact, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has indicated they will not only have the hearing we had yesterday on this topic, but also the chairman and the ranking member and their staffs will work over the recess to get this legislation front and center in our committee and, presumably, on the Senate floor.\",\n                \"This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Collins and Senator King of Maine.

While the Department of Veterans Affairs believes Congress should resolve this, we haven't. What I do know is veterans who are entitled to care are not receiving it, and, in a sense, false promises were made until we get this issue corrected and the VA then implements the choice act as intended.\",\n                \"This is an important issue. I would say to my colleagues, particularly those who served in the Senate with me in the last 4 years, in my view, we haven't accomplished much in those 4 years, but one of the areas in which we did come together and did pass significant legislation was the choice act. Now we need to make certain that accomplishment results in those who are entitled to those benefits receiving them.\",\n                \"Who, I would ask, in this country would we expect to have the best quality health care? Who would we expect? I think it would be those who served our country--our military men and women, those who retired and became veterans. And I would say that the employees and Members of Congress have the opportunity of choosing a hospital or a doctor, and our veterans ought to have the same opportunity.\",\n                \"Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to explain this amendment.

They have never stepped back from their desire to obliterate Israel and to destroy the United States. Our Arab friends see Iran creating a satellite ``Shia Crescent'' stretching to the Mediterranean and consisting of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. To their south and west, they see Iran gaining control of Yemen.

When the Egyptian generals overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood, who were waging war against Coptic Christians and openly spoke of renewing the fight against Israel--the State Department condemned them as ``undemocratic.''

We have now considered over 60 bills to repeal, defund, or dismantle the Affordable Care Act, rather than improve and build upon it.\",\n                \"With all the work that remains to be done, we could be debating legislation to renew our expiring highway trust fund and repair our crumbling roads and bridges.\",\n                \"We could take up legislation to renew the charter of the Import-Export Bank, and we will be offering that soon on the previous question.\",\n                \"We could consider a bill to repair our broken immigration system or help the millions of Americans who are living below the poverty line, even though they work two jobs and it is increasingly hard to support their families; or we could take on the critical matter of climate change and confront the fact that it has contributed to one of the worst droughts in our Nation's history.\",\n                \"But, oh, no, it is more important to have the 61st and 62nd repeal of parts of the Affordable Care Act, rather than move forward with a future-oriented agenda for the American people.\",\n                \"Now, let's get into some of the specifics of the underlying legislation. The most recent estimate by the Congressional Budget Office found that a total of 27 million people will gain access to healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years, who otherwise would not have had coverage.\",\n                \"That is to say nothing of the additional millions of Americans who benefit from the Affordable Care Act by having coverage for preexisting conditions for the first time in their lives, are no longer subject to lifetime caps that could leave them bankrupt if they get a serious illness, or people that are able to stay as young adults up to age 26 on their parents' plan.\",\n                \"Constituents from all areas of my district have shared stories of their success using our State's health exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, and described how the Affordable Care Act's coverage provided by the ACA has improved their lives.\",\n                \"I have heard from constituents like Morgan, from Nederland, Colorado, who used the exchange to enroll in the exact same plan she had before the Affordable Care Act, but her premiums decreased, and the services that were covered expanded--more value for her money.\",\n                \"Or Donna, who recently moved to Boulder, Colorado--Donna is an outdoor enthusiast, like so many in my district, but was afraid to make her way to the mountains until she had secured healthcare coverage.\",\n                \"Through Connect for Health Colorado and the premium tax credits she has access to under the Affordable Care Act, she is now enrolled in a comprehensive medical and dental plan that ensures she won't become bankrupt if she sustains an injury.\",\n                \"These are far from isolated cases. In my home State of Colorado, 16.5 percent of people lacked health insurance before ACA. According to a recent study of the Kaiser Family Foundation, that figure has dropped to 9 percent by last year.\",\n                \"The success is not limited to my State. According to a Gallup poll released in April, the percentage of Americans lacking health care nationwide has dropped by more than a third since the marketplace opened at the end of 2013, from 18 percent to under 12 percent.\",\n                \"The Affordable Care Act is working; instead of continuing in that vein, once again, the Republican Congress is seeking to repeal various parts of that law, rather than move forward and improve it.\",\n                \"The first of today's two bills, the so-called Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act, doesn't protect anyone's access to anything. The Advisory Board it seeks to repeal, which has been vilified and completely mischaracterized in the past, is actually something far more mundane and important to the processes of Medicare.\",\n                \"It is a board of advisers who make nonbinding recommendations to Congress about how we can reduce healthcare costs and strengthen Medicare solvency over the long term, without sacrificing the quality of care, something that all of us, as cost-conscious Members of Congress, should be interested in seeing.\",\n                \"Now, we can debate all day the exact composition of the Board or which committees in Congress should have jurisdiction over its recommendations. Those are valid considerations--or, instead, we can discuss repealing the Board in its entirety, which is what we are talking about here today. This Advisory Board will provide critical advice to help Congress reduce the cost of providing health care.\",\n                \"Now, interestingly enough, this amendment pays for the $7 billion cost of eliminating this Board by slashing nearly $9 billion in funding from the prevention and public health fund. This fund is used for vital preventative health programs, like childhood vaccines, helping people quit smoking, stroke prevention, and maternal wellness. The cornerstone of health savings is preventative medicine.\",\n                \"In fact, I cosponsor a bill with my friend, Mr. Burgess, who is managing the bill on the other side, that would allow the Congressional Budget Office to account for the long-term savings of preventative health initiatives when it scores legislation.\",\n                \"If Mr. Burgess' own bill were to become law, and I hope it does, it would show that the so-called way that we are paying for this repeal is illusory. Eliminating the preventative healthcare program actually can cost money in the long run. Under the congressional scoring model that we both support, it would likely not even register as a cost saving, or if it did, it would be much less than the $9 billion.\",\n                \"The second bill being considered, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, aims to do something that many of us on both sides support, repealing the Affordable Care Act's excise tax on medical devices. The medical device tax is one of the measures originally included by the Senate in the Affordable Care Act to fund the badly needed consumer protections and benefits that form the core of the bill.\",\n                \"Now, again, it is easy to support tax cuts. This body has put before us many, tax cut after tax cut after tax cut that are unfunded. The whole discussion about how you can afford to cut taxes is how you pay for it. What government waste do you cut? What other taxes or income do you use to offset the cost of these tax cuts?\",\n                \"Of course, we don't want to slow the pace of progress with unnecessary costs and burdens, and we want to make sure that medical device manufacturers have every incentive to increase their research and development and not pass these costs along to consumers.\",\n                \"Unfortunately, even though I, along with Alma Adams from North Carolina and Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania, offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have paid for repealing the medical device tax using a commonsense approach that wouldn't suppress economic growth, our amendment was not allowed to even be discussed here on the floor of the House.\",\n                \"Not only would our amendment to pay for the medical device repeal have avoided adding nearly $30 billion to our deficit, as this bill would do before us today, but it also would have helped bring balance to our Nation's energy sector by stopping the government from choosing winners and losers in energy and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels.\",\n                \"Unfortunately, under this rule, we don't get a vote or debate on the floor. We are left with two bad choices. We can, of course, leave in place a tax that many of us want to remove; or we can add $25 billion to our deficit. Neither of those are the right answers for the American people or for medical device companies or the consumers who use medical device products.\",\n                \"The American people deserve better. If we defeat this rule, an open process will allow Republicans and Democrats to offer real, constructive, better ideas of how to improve upon these two pieces of legislation.\",\n                \"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/06/17/H4449-5_providing-for-consideration-of-hr-160-protect-medi/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"D\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-06-17\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"P000598\",\n            \"pages\": \"H4449-H4455\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"Polis\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. polis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": null,\n            \"speaker_first\": null,\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ AND SYRIA\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-06-17/html/CREC-2015-06-17-pt1-PgH4455.htm\",\n            \"number\": 97,\n            \"order\": 45,\n            \"volume\": 161,\n            \"chamber\": \"House\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-06-17-pt1-PgH4455.chunk45\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \"Mr. Speaker, this hour, this minute, this second is actually a gift to the American people.

He was murdered on his own ranch in 2010. This is as it was reported by The Arizona Republic:\",\n                \"On a breezy spring morning, a red ATV rolled across southeastern Arizona's border badlands beneath the mystical Chiricahua Mountains. A gray-haired rancher in classic cowboy attire--jeans, boots, denim vest, and shirt--was at the wheel, accompanied by his dog, Blue. Robert Krentz, 58, was checking stock ponds and water lines on the 35,000-acre spread not far from where Apache leader Geronimo surrendered to the U.S. cavalry. The Krentz clan began raising cattle there more than a century ago, shortly before Mexican Revolution leader Pancho Villa prowled nearby. In modern times, the sparsely populated San Bernardino Valley, bordering New Mexico and Senora, became a magnet for bird watchers and a haven for smugglers. Krentz pulled to a stop, as he noticed a man apparently injured. The rancher made a garbled radio call to his brother, Phil--something about an illegal alien hurt; call Border Patrol. It was about 10:30 a.m., March 27, 2010. What happened that morning as shots echoed across the grassy range would roil Arizona politics and fuel the U.S. immigration debate for years to come. One day earlier, Phil had put Border Patrol agents onto a group of suspected drug runners on the family's land, resulting in eight arrests and the seizure of 200 pounds of marijuana. After Krentz's broken radio transmission, family members almost immediately launched a search.\",\n                \"And also neighbors. There were other ranchers in the area that started this search, trying to track the killers, and they enlisted help to track the footsteps south.\",\n                \"Rob was found just before midnight, his body lying on the ground with his feet still inside the all-terrain vehicle. Two 9-millimeter slugs had fatally penetrated his lungs. Another bullet wounded his dog, which had to be euthanized. Krentz carried a rifle and pistol in his Polaris Ranger but apparently never got a chance to use them. After being shot, he managed to drive about 1,000 feet before collapsing. The only immediate sign of an assailant was a set of footprints. Trackers followed them nearly 20 miles south to Mexico, where the trail vanished.\",\n                \"His murderers have never been caught to this day. Rob Krentz' family deals with this grief and deals with the fear of the border not being secured and what is going to happen next to them. This is very real in southern Arizona.\",\n                \"In 2010, Brian Terry, a Border Patrol agent, was also murdered by smugglers in our district.\",\n                \"On December 14, 2010, Border Patrol Agents William Castano, Gabriel Fragoza, Timothy Keller, and Brian Terry demonstrated extreme bravery while facing a lethal threat from a superior number of armed subjects suspected of trafficking drugs in the area.\",\n                \"And I am reading from a citation, where he earned the 2010 Congressional Badge of Bravery.\",\n                \"All four agents were operating as members of a small four- man rural assault element tasked with interdicting armed suspects operating west of the town of Rio Rico, Arizona. This four-man element had occupied a remote interdiction site consisting of rugged, steep, and difficult terrain for a period of 48 hours without relief. At approximately 11 p.m., the team was alerted to at least five suspects moving into the interdiction zone. Without regard for individual safety, the small team maneuvered into a position to interdict and apprehend the five individuals passing directly in front of them. As the agents identified themselves, suddenly and without warning, the subjects opened fire on them. Placing themselves at great risk of serious physical injury or death, all four agents bravely stood their ground in an attempt to provide vital protection for their teammates. During the short and horrific gun battle, Agent Brian Terry sustained a fatal injury. Realizing that Agent Terry had been injured, the team, without hesitation, continued to selflessly place themselves in harm's way by attempting to provide lifesaving techniques for Agent Terry and providing perimeter security, preventing the assailants from maneuvering on their position. One of the suspects was wounded during the incident and was ultimately taken into custody.\",\n                \"Brian Terry is a hero. Rob Krentz was on his property when he was murdered. Brian Terry was brutally murdered.\",\n                \"Let me tell you another story, one of rancher Kelly Glenn Kimbro, a fourth generation rancher. I am reading from an email that she sent to me in June, just an incident that she had on her ranch east of Douglas.\",\n                \"A couple of days ago, I was driving from the Malpai Ranch to Douglas on Geronimo Trail. At mile marker 11, I could see motion ahead of me in the road; and as I approached, 13 men formed a barricade with their bodies across the road. I slowed and tried to pass on the right. They moved right. I had locked my doors as I approached and my windows were up. Knowing that I had to either run over several of them, I stopped. They immediately surrounded my truck. Two fellows stood in front of my truck with their hands on the hood, holding me in place. Several guys started to climb onto the running boards and into the back. One was rummaging around my tools. I was thinking that if he proceeded to break a window that I would possibly use my pistol. I was not sure if I was being hijacked or what.\",\n                \"Think about it. This is a woman alone in her truck, with 13 men stopping her in her tracks.\",\n                \"I put my window down a couple inches and told them to get back. They started talking English. They were frantic to have me take them to the ``police.'' They stated they were from India. I talked them out of my truck and back onto the side of the road, promised them I would, no doubt, call Border Patrol, and they let me leave. Yep, scared me for a few minutes.\",\n                \"Let me tell you, Kelly Glenn Kimbro is a tough woman. She is a rancher. She is a mountain lion hunter. She is cool under pressure. How would you behave in that circumstance?\",\n                \"The challenge that she has--and she has got an 18-year-old daughter who often drives home alone. They are having to make life-and-death decisions. How did she know that they were not armed? How did she know what their intentions were? And if she decided to hit the gas and did harm them, then they would be questioning her actions because they were, in fact, unarmed.\",\n                \"This is just the type of circumstances that these people are dealing with, just living in their own homes, just going in and out of their own community, just traveling to the store and going about their business.\",\n                \"There are a couple of other stories.\",\n                \"Gary Thrasher is a rancher and veterinarian who has worked and practiced in Cochise County since 1984. Over the past 30 years, he has seen how border security issues have led to dramatic changes in the county's way of life.\",\n                \"Gary lives about 3 miles from the border. Over the past 4 years, 11 of his ranch family clients have sold out, and that has had a big economic impact on his practice as well. They have just decided to give up. They can't afford to ranch in the area under this danger anymore. Many of those families have just said that they can't deal with the threats and the anxieties of life along the U.S.-Mexico border; and for the ranchers who remain, it has become increasingly hard to find people who want to work on their ranch near a border that is constantly crossed with these transnational criminal organizations.\",\n                \"Another rancher shared, anonymously, that he has got a couple of houses, one 2 miles and one 40 miles from the border, and he has got far more trouble at the house 40 miles from the border. He has had, according to him, 15 to 16 break-ins, home invasions, and one of them was just 3 weeks ago.\",\n                \"One last story from another rancher. He and his son, they said they left the ranch. Someone broke in, stole food, and then they left. The next day, they saw individuals moving north. The son pursued them, and the Border Patrol then captured them. It turned out, according to this rancher, that, after breaking into his ranch, they broke into a hunter's property and stole a weapon. The pistol was ditched before they were caught but connected back to them. Who knows what their intentions were.\",\n                \"This is the challenge that these people have.\",\n                \"The rancher talked with the migrant criminal. And he said he admitted to being a lifetime criminal and a repeat offender. He is just used by these traffickers going back and forth. He was detained for 2 days, and he wasn't charged with weapons charges or multiple entries, and he was sent back to Mexico, again, to probably be used by these transnational criminal organizations.\",\n                \"This is very real to southern Arizona. The transnational criminal organizations are daily trafficking.\",\n                \"There is another photo I have right here, and you can see on the other side of the photo, a number of individuals that are just mules. They are packing drugs, and they are just going through their property.\",\n                \"There are other photos I have here related to some of the ranchers who--there is just no fence. Again, as we talked about earlier, the fence is not the only solution, but fencing will at least delay the activity. This is just one of the rancher's pictures of just a barbed wire fence that is easy to be cut through on foot or with a vehicle.\",\n                \"So I am urging my colleagues to pass this border security bill. I am urging those who are listening to please contact your Members of Congress in the House and the Senate. Let's not play politics with securing our border.

They decided that one department would be funded on what they call a continuing resolution, which means kind of grabbing last year's budget and trying to make it work this year.

It has become shorthand for a challenge we have with our broken immigration system.

They grew up in this country, and they went to school in this country. They speak English. They have dreams about what they will do with their future, but being undocumented they are unable to realize those dreams.\",\n                \"The DREAM Act said if they have a clean criminal record, have graduated from high school, are willing to serve in our military or go on to college, we will give them a path to legalization in America. These are young people who know no other country. These are young people raised in America, educated in our educational system--at the expense of our taxpayers, I might add. They have been successful in life and want to continue to be a part of America. They only know one flag--the one they pledge allegiance to every morning in their classroom, which is the same one we on the Senate Floor. They only know one national anthem. Yet they are being told by the Republicans they should leave.\",\n                \"How many are there? We estimate 2 million across our country. There are 600,000 who have signed up for President Obama's protection program, called DACA, which says that on a 2-year basis they will not be deported. What the Republicans have said is: We want to deport these DREAMers--2 million of them--and let's start with the 600,000 who have stepped up for protection from deportation. So they are risking funding the Department of Homeland Security in order to make their point that DREAMers have to go.\",\n                \"Well, let's at least take a look at one of these DREAMers and understand the kind of people we are talking about. This is Johana Mejias. Johana was brought to the United States from Venezuela when she was a child. She grew up in Boulder, CO. She played on her high school softball team. She played viola in the orchestra and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Here is what Johana said about her childhood:\",\n                \"I've become a Boulderite in all aspects of that word. That town, with those beautiful mountains, is truly my home.\",\n                \"In 2011 Johana graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a double major. I am going to try to describe her major, but as a liberal arts lawyer I may get lost in some of these scientific terms. Here was Johana's major at the University of Colorado: molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, and psychology-neuroscience.\",\n                \"Johana finished at the University of Colorado without any government assistance because she is undocumented. She made it through these challenging majors, graduating with this double major. Her dream? To become a doctor. It was a dream she thought might never come to be because she is undocumented. She literally has no country. Then something happened. In 2012 President Barack Obama signed an Executive order called DACA, and Johana heard there was actually a medical school that was willing to admit students who qualified under this DACA protection--Loyola University Stritch College of Medicine in the city of Chicago. She couldn't believe it, and she applied quickly. Johana was accepted because she is an extraordinarily bright and promising young medical student.\",\n                \"Like many States across the country, my home State of Illinois faces a shortage of physicians in some communities. Loyola University decided if a DACA-protected young graduate is willing to come here and qualifies in the competitive field of admissions to medical school, they can come to Loyola medical school if they promise to give 1 year of service after they are doctors for every year of medical school, and if they promise to go to an underserved area in the inner city or rural areas where there are not enough doctors. Johana signed up for that. She said it was worth it. She would give 1 year of her life for each year of medical school if she was just given a chance to become a doctor.\",\n                \"This DACA loan program we have created is one that allows these students to receive the loans they need to finish at Loyola medical school. Last fall Johana began medical school at Loyola. I was there on one of her first days, and I met her. She is even more impressive than anything I could say in this speech. After she graduates, she has agreed to stay in my State of Illinois to help people who need a doctor.\",\n                \"Here is what she wrote to me in a letter about her life experience:\",\n                \"When the year 2012 came along, my life changed. My dreams of becoming a doctor became a possibility again because of \",\n                \"Isn't that an amazing story--that a young girl would come here, realize she was undocumented, fight her way through for a bachelor's degree in these challenging subjects, continuing to keep alive the dream that maybe, just maybe something would happen to give her a chance to become a doctor? Then the President signs this Executive order, and now she is in medical school.\",\n                \"Because this medical school is in Chicago, my State is going to benefit when she becomes a doctor because she will go to one of my down-State communities that is begging for a doctor. She will go to one of the inner-city neighborhoods in Chicago and serve people who are struggling to get basic medical care.\",\n                \"What an amazing story--an amazing story that will come to a bitter end if the Republicans have their way on this bill.\",\n                \"The Republican answer to Johana is: After all of your life's work, after all of your dreams are fulfilled, leave--leave America. They are prepared to deport her and 600,000 others just like her. They think America will be a better nation if we get rid of someone like Johana. What are they thinking?\",\n                \"They are challenging the very funding of the Department of Homeland Security with this strategy of deporting the DREAMers. It doesn't make any sense. Whether you are conservative or liberal, this makes no sense--to spend $9,000 to deport her instead of finding $9,000 to help her finish medical school and be part of America's future.\",\n                \"We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and I stand on the floor of the Senate proudly representing the State of Illinois. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story.\",\n                \"Those who have devised a strategy--what I consider to be a divisive, negative, hateful strategy--toward young people such as her are not thinking clearly about who we are as Americans. We are a nation of immigrants. People from all across this world have had the courage to pick up and come to America, to work some of the toughest, dirtiest, hardest jobs so their kids, such as Johana, would have a chance for a better future. That story has been repeated over and over millions of times. Republicans, with their strategy, their anti-immigration strategy, would kill that dream, kill that story.\",\n                \"I hope we have the good sense to fund the Department of Homeland Security. If there is going to be a debate about the DREAMers and their future, count me in. I want to be part of it. I want to come to the floor and tell these stories about real lives affected by these political decisions, and I trust in the outcome in the Senate. But don't stop the funding for the Department of Homeland Security in the meantime.

This measure would allow the President to pass sweeping trade partnerships without the input of the American people through their elected representatives in the normal process. Despite the various myths circulating about TPA, I sincerely believe that it is not in the best interest of our Nation, as written at this time.\",\n                \"You have heard it said that a vote against TPA is a vote against international trade, but actually, a vote against TPA is a vote for a better construct and trade agreement.\",\n                \"I am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated strategically in the best interest of the United States economically, militarily, and diplomatically. With the President leaving office in just months, I have serious concerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have decades of implication.\",\n                \"Many have said TPA will strengthen our international relationships, and that may be, but while TPA would fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in specific, currently being negotiated by the President with 11 other Pacific nations, I am not convinced that this is a partnership that must be done in haste before the President leaves office.\",\n                \"We currently trade with 6 of the 11 other members. Our vital yet delicate relationship with China--a country not included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership--would likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic influence in the region. The Trans-Pacific Partnership rewards nations with serious human rights violations while slighting our faithful trade partners with shared values in Europe. While I support the lifting of trade barriers and promoting better standards of living, I believe we must do the right track, not the fast track.\",\n                \"Others have claimed TPA will strengthen national security. On this point we should take careful note. The President has used dangerous and isolating language regarding China, with words coming from the White House like ``hegemony'' and ``containment'' to ask for the TPA, or the trade promotional authority, but we must note that China is not our enemy. Therefore, we should not put it on the path to become one.\",\n                \"By isolating China, we could easily transform our capabilities-based defense strategy to a threat-based one, with all of the implication and decades of effort that that would entail. It would affect all of our future defense spending and could even begin Cold War II. The trade promotional authority can be granted and trade agreements inked without making China excluded, or worse, our enemy. We need to use the next 20 months to repair the relationships as we move towards better trade agreements.\",\n                \"The trade promotional authority, some say, gives Congress a seat at the negotiating table. But the TPA allows Congress to set broad objectives for negotiation--and that comes at a high price. Under the trade promotional authority, Congress sacrifices its authority to make any changes on the final deal, and they are left with a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' vote.\",\n                \"I believe the American people deserve their voice in trade agreements which impact all of our livelihoods and affect all of our families' finances. And while trade is vital to economic opportunity and our international friendships, I cannot support granting the President permission in light of these concerns with trade promotional authority.\",\n                \"Madam Speaker, America has long been fascinated with China. From the time of Columbus, who sought to find a western approach to China and instead discovered America, we have been drawn to its ancient culture and its people. The earliest American vessel pulled into a Canton port in 1748. Forty years later, we began free trade with the Cantonese.\",\n                \"The first mention of China obtaining a favored nation status was actually as early as 1844, when we signed the Treaty of Wanghia. The way seemed open to engage China and her market. But there were concerns. Wrote one negotiating diplomat regarding this treaty: ``It is the most uncivilized and remote of all nations . . . it is in an isolated place outside the pale, solitary, and ignorant. Not only are the people entirely unversed in the forms of edicts and laws, but if the meaning be rather deep, they would probably not even be able to comprehend. It would seem that we must make our words somewhat simple.''\",\n                \"What is amusing is that the diplomat was Chinese, and his comments were directed toward the United States.\",\n                \"China moved ahead slowly and cautiously with its relations with the West. The interplay of Western covetousness with Chinese reluctance kept the door to China at a mere crack. European attempts to force the crack with opium and acquisition of port cities broadened the natural distrust.\",\n                \"Unlike demands of Europe, though, the United States wanted trade, not territory. U.S. Ambassador Burlingame was able to secure the first treaty that China ever made with any Western nation in 1861, and China was regarded as an equal. Chinese workers began to flock to the United States and literally began to move mountains in California as economic opportunity thrived.\",\n                \"Unfortunately, the goodwill of Lincoln faded in just one generation. The plundering of Chinese port cities by European competitors changed how Americans began to view China. The flood of Chinese immigrants to California became an easy target for any setback on its economic ascent. Equals were now called coolies. Racism reached such a height that in 1882 the United States Congress--this body--passed and the President signed the first ever act that excluded a specific race on immigration. We did not even make any pretense about it, calling it the Chinese Exclusion Act. The provisions remained in effect for nearly 60 years.\",\n                \"As these events played out, Commodore Perry of the United States Navy entered Tokyo in 1850 and demanded that Japan ``open up.'' The Japanese obliged.\",\n                \"Japan embarked on a stunning modernization program, where China was reluctant. In an incredible span of only 50 years, Japan adopted Western technology, governance, law, industry, and military doctrines. Her rise from mystic feudalism to world power alarmed the West. In response, the goodwill of Lincoln towards China would take hold again in the form of his youthful personal secretary, John Hay, now an older, wiser, and towering figure of respect serving as the Secretary of State in 1900.\",\n                \"Hay saw the best way to compete with Japan would be to open up China to trade while protecting her territory. Hays' open-door policy was widely heralded across the globe as the solution to imperial Japanese ascendancy. This would have long-lasting implication, but one important side effect was to restore U.S.-Chinese relations. Hay even secured a guarantee from Japan in 1908 to respect China's ``open door,'' independence, and territory. It would last only 7 years.\",\n                \"As China moved to become more enlightened to the West with Sun Yat-sen's revolution in self-governance in China, Imperial Japan made what was known as the 21 Demands during World War I.\",\n                \"Great Britain and U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan moved quickly to prevent Japan from attempting to make China its own protectorate.

The U.S. responded by calling for a global quarantine against Japan in defense of China in 1937. China's own struggles internally with Mao Zedong's Communists paled in comparison to losing its industrial heart and its coast to the Imperial Japanese army.\",\n                \"By 1941, America was sending lend-lease war material and economic aid to China in her defense. American volunteer pilots cut dashing figures as they flew American P-40 Warhawks for the Chinese Air Force as the famed Flying Tigers.\",\n                \"Ultimately, America's defense of China led it to be attacked at Pearl Harbor and resulted in a brutal Pacific and Chinese theater of war during World War II.\",\n                \"The United States committed an entire effort in China, with ``Vinegar Joe'' Stilwell as the commanding general; the building of the Burma Road; and by training, equipping, and launching a Chinese Army to attack Japanese forces.

The controversial California Water Fix, formerly known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP), is an outdated and destructive plumbing system. It does not create any new water nor does it provide the water and the ecological protection that the Golden State must have. California and the federal government must set aside this big, expensive, destructive plumbing plan and immediately move forward with a comprehensive approach that includes:\",\n                \"1) Conservation,\",\n                \"2) Recycling,\",\n                \"3) The creation of new storage systems,\",\n                \"4) Fix the Delta--right sized conveyance, levee improvements, and habitat restoration,\",\n                \"5) Science driven process,\",\n                \"6) Protection of existing water rights.\",\n                \"This combination of projects constitutes a comprehensive water plan for the state.\",\n                \"Through a comprehensive plan that brings all stakeholders to the table, California can solve its water needs, and it can avoid the continuous water wars that have long divided our state. Unfortunately, California is once again embroiled in a bitter water war brought about by the California Water Fix (BDCP), the most recent attempt to fix California's water supply. After more than five years of study and over $200,000,000 spent on consultants, the process has become bogged down and turned into another battle pitting north vs. south, water exporters vs. environmentalists, and senior water right holders vs. new comers. A classic California water brawl is in full bloom.\",\n                \"The governor's water plan for California is to take water out of the Sacramento River just south of Sacramento and put it into two tunnels each 40 miles long, 40 feet in diameter and with a potential capacity of moving 15,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). While the current proposal is set up to move 9000 cfs, the twin tunnels have a much larger capacity therefore setting the system up for future expansion. Pumping would also continue directly from the southern Delta at the Tracy pumps. The system will be able to deliver up to 5.3 million acre feet of water to the pumps in Tracy and then on to the San Joaquin Valley farmers and Los Angeles.\",\n                \"So what is wrong with the Water Fix (BDCP)? It is not a water plan for California. It does not create one gallon of new water. It does not solve the long term needs of the state. With a minimum estimated construction and operating cost over 50 years of $24.5 billion, it is an extraordinarily expensive plumbing system dressed up with a coating of habitat restoration. The plan simply takes water from one region and delivers it to another while tearing up acres of prime agricultural farm land in the process. All of this while stoking the fire of divisiveness over water that has plagued our state for years.\",\n                \"A quick look at the water flow in the Sacramento River over the last two decades shows that approximately six months out of the year there is somewhere between 15 and 20 thousand cubic feet per second (cfs) of water flowing in the Sacramento River. This proposal has the potential to suck the river dry and destroy the largest delta estuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. Critical habitat for dozens of fish species like salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon would be threatened. These fish and the water they live in are crucial for jobs, agriculture and fishing businesses, and the region's economy.\",\n                \"We should never build a water system that has such destructive potential. It is never safe to assume that ecological concerns will trump greed and thirst. We should keep in mind that in 2012 the U.S. House of Representatives voted on H.R. 1837, the euphemistically titled Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Reliability Act. The bill passed by a vote of 246 to 175 and swept away all environmental protections for the Delta while stealing 800,000 acre feet of water from the aquatic environment. Luckily, the legislation was derailed in the U.S. Senate, but H.R. 1837 in one form or another is likely to return in future legislative battles.\",\n                \"California must move beyond a patched plumbing system. We need to think about what California really needs, and what it needs is a comprehensive water plan. Big changes are coming that threaten our water supply and our economy. A short list of these challenges include: climate change and related weather events, population growth, world food supplies, and earthquakes.\",\n                \"Climate change is real and its effect on California will be significant. The Colorado River Basin is in a prolonged drought, and likely to be much drier in the future. Based on today's water flows, the water in the Colorado River is oversubscribed by a third and projections indicate less water in the future. This is a big, big problem for the seven states that rely on the river, and especially for Southern California.\",\n                \"The Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Central Valley, and the coastal ranges will also be drastically impacted by climate change. We know that the timing of the precipitation is going to change and the snow is already melting earlier. As a result, the snowpack is moving up the mountains and while it may be deeper at the higher altitudes, the amount of land it covers is greatly reduced. It's the lower snowpack that has the greatest volumes of water and if that continues to recede, we will have less and less water. The 2009 ``California Water Plan,'' published by the California Department of Water Resources, estimates that the snowpack will decrease 25-40 percent by 2050. We must also anticipate more severe storms and flooding. All of this means the natural and man-made storage systems will hold less water. Putting the denial of scientific facts aside, California has to deal with the reality of climate change and its water policy implications.\",\n                \"We know California's population will continue to grow and therefore, the demand for water will increase. We know the world will be very hungry in the future, and we know that the role of agriculture in California is going to be exceedingly important. California agriculture not only fills our own desire for diverse and nutritious foods, but it will also continue to meet basic food needs for people around the world and will continue to serve as an essential component of our nation's economy.\",\n                \"We know the Delta is in serious trouble. The fish species are threatened with extinction and a total collapse of the estuary ecosystem is possible if the current water pumping program continues. Rising sea levels and deferred maintenance threaten the Delta levees which protect nearly 500,000 people, thousands of acres of valuable farm land, and miles of critical highways, gas and water transmission lines, and water delivery channels. Major upgrades are needed.\",\n                \"For these reasons, California must take off its blinders and expand its scope when thinking about ways to manage its water supply. It must be a holistic approach that is applied to every project that will impact the water needs of all Californians.\",\n                \"To achieve this comprehensive approach, here are six specific actions to provide a foundation for California's water future. If California does all of these, we will create new water supplies and better use the resources we already have:\",\n                \"1) Conservation,\",\n                \"2) Recycling,\",\n                \"3) The creation of new storage systems,\",\n                \"4) Fix the Delta--right sized conveyance, levee improvements, and habitat restoration,\",\n                \"5) Science driven process,\",\n                \"6) Protection of existing water rights\",\n                \"The quickest and cheapest source of new water is to stretch our current supplies by conserving what we have. Californians have been at this for years in our cities, in our industries, on the farm, and in our homes. We have engaged in serious water conservation, yet more can and should be done everywhere.\",\n                \"There are many conservation strategies. One conservation strategy is to use devices that measure the moisture in the soil to provide real time monitoring of the exact amount of water needed for ideal growing conditions. These devices are connected to a computer that automatically turns on just the right amount of water. These systems are in use and conserve at least ten percent with a financial payback in less than one year. If they were deployed widely perhaps at least 1 percent of the 30 million acre feet of water consumed by agriculture could be saved each year (300,000 acre feet).\",\n                \"All of us are going to do a lot more water conservation, not just the agriculture community. The water conservation mandate set by the state is a 20 percent reduction per capita by 2020 which equals 1,600,000 acre feet. In a very real way conservation can create new water that was not previously available for use. To be on the conservative side, let us assume that just one quarter of the State's goal could be obtained in the next decade, thereby adding 400,000 acre feet of new water to our supplies each year.\",\n                \"Can you name the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere? It's the water that flows out of the sanitation plants in Southern California and is dumped into the Pacific Ocean.\",\n                \"Why would any sane government take water from the Sacramento River, pump it 500 miles south, lift it 5,000 feet in the air, clean it, use it once, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in Southern California, then dump it in the ocean? California does just this as it discharges over 3.5 million acre feet of water to the ocean each year, much of which could be reused.\",\n                \"We need to think seriously about recycling, not just in Southern California, but everywhere. The State of California currently recycles approximately 650,000 acre feet of water each year and has set a water recycling goal of 1.5 million acre feet of new water in California by 2020, and 2.5 million acre feet by 2030. While achievable, WateReuse California estimates this goal cannot be achieved without State regulatory changes to expand the types of recycling available that rely on existing technologies.\",\n                \"Another option is desalination of the ocean. This is feasible and used extensively throughout the world, however it is not a viable option for all communities. It costs about 40 percent more to desalinate sea water than to recycle water using current technology. However, technological advances are being pursued for both recycling and desalination that could lower the costs of both.\",\n                \"In the next ten years, conservation and recycling in California can create approximately 2.2 million acre feet of new water to use each year, and that can increase to 3.2 million acre feet in twenty years. This is new water that is not available today because it is wasted or pumped out to sea. It can be developed at a reasonable cost when compared to all other alternatives that might be out there. Conservation and recycling are steps one and two in a comprehensive water program for California.\",\n                \"Water storage south of the Delta is possible and necessary. The capacity of the great Delta pumps near Tracy is 15,000 cubic feet per second. They are designed to meet maximum demand south of the Delta. They do not operate year round, only when there is sufficient water in the Delta, when threatened fish are not near the pumps, and when there is agricultural and urban demand south of the Tracy pumps. There is very limited water storage capacity south of the Delta. We must build more. San Luis and Los Vaqueros reservoirs could be expanded. New dams could be built at Los Banos Grandes, Temperance Flats, and numerous smaller off stream sites throughout the San Joaquin Valley. There are extensive and numerous aquifers throughout the San Joaquin Valley that may prove suitable to store additional water that would be used in a conjunctive water management system. With these water storage facilities in place and a smaller cross Delta facility operating year round, the need for havoc causing, excessive pumping in the Delta could be avoided.\",\n                \"When coupled with recycling, the underground aquifers in Southern California are another key to our water future. The underground aquifers of the Santa Ana River in Orange County, the San Fernando Basin, Chino Basin, San Bernardino, San Gabriel Basin, and others have a combined capacity larger than Shasta Reservoir, the largest man made reservoir in the state. Today, some recycled water is put into the underground water basins to be stored for those inevitably dry years. When needed, it is pumped out, used, cleaned and returned to storage. On a larger scale this recycling system could create as much as 2.5 million acre feet of new water, and thereby reduce the need for shifting Colorado River supplies and imports from the Sacramento River.\",\n                \"Surface and underground storage should be used in a conjunctive water management program. Use the rivers when there is lots of water and use the reservoirs when there is little. Another way to describe this strategy is ``big gulp'' and ``little sips.'' When there are low flows in the Delta the system would take a little sip. When there is excessive water in the Delta, the system would take a big gulp, but there must be some place to put that water when the big gulp is taken. Therefore, the surface and sub-surface reservoirs south of the Delta become an essential element in a California water plan.\",\n                \"Water storage north of the Delta is also important, and three proposals are on the books today. An off stream reservoir at Sites, located west of Williams, has great promise for storage and for creating greater flexibility in managing the Sacramento River for salmon runs, water demand, and Delta outflow. This reservoir can deliver 500,000 acre feet of annual yield and the additional flexibility that it offers can under some scenarios save another 500,000 acre feet of water that would otherwise be released into the river systems. Raising Shasta Dam is also possible, as is better conjunctive management of the many aquifers in the Sacramento Valley. State and federal agencies have already commenced studies for these projects. A quick completion of these studies is essential.\",\n                \"The current plan for the California Water Fix (BDCP) is a dual use facility with the main focus on the twin tunnels with a capacity of 15,000 cubic feet per second, and the continued use of the Delta channels for moving water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers to the Tracy pumps. This dual use system adds another layer of risk to the eco-system and agricultural economy of the Delta with the potential for the massive tunnels to suck the Delta dry from the north and from the south with the thirsty pumps. In scale, the cost and destructive potential of this project will rival the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China. The twin tunnel proposal is a large scale, destructive project that does not create one gallon of new water for a thirsty California.\",\n                \"The location of the intakes for the twin tunnels is in the heart of the rich farm lands of the northern Delta, near the small community of Courtland. Thousands of acres of valuable farmland essential to California agriculture production will be destroyed during construction of the project, and, following completion, a vast industrial zone of pumping stations, fish screens, reservoirs, and electrical stations will impede on one of California's great agricultural regions. Along the forty mile route of the twin tunnels the construction process will produce a total of 22 million cubic yards of tunnel muck. This combination of soil and conditioning agents will have to be stored and managed and the latest draft of the plan calls for storage areas along the tunnel ranging in size from 100 to 570 acres. The amount of muck extracted would be enough to cover 100 football fields to a height of roughly 100 feet, and in the end will destroy close to 1600 acres of farm land while disrupting domestic and agricultural water wells.\",\n                \"Go forward carefully; start small; use science to evaluate each step; then proceed to the next step. Remember the Delta is a unique and precious environmental asset. We must take care of it. A narrowly focused plumbing system like the California Water Fix/BDCP will not achieve progress in creating a water supply sufficient for California's future. We must pursue a holistic, comprehensive approach that will achieve a bigger bang for our buck.\",\n                \"First, reduce demand on the Delta with steps one, two and three: water conservation, recycling, and strategic use of storage facilities. Use the ``Big Gulp, Little Sip'' pumping strategy. Move forward with the flood plain and fresh and saltwater marsh habitat improvements. Repair and improve the key Delta levees. Evaluate the effect on the Delta as these projects come on line.\",\n                \"Then, and only if necessary, proceed with a conveyance system that is much smaller and with a reduced capacity to destroy.\",\n                \"A much smaller facility with a capacity of no more than 3,000 cubic feet per second could be built to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. With the normal minimum flows in the Sacramento River above 15,000 cfs, a small 3,000 cfs facility could operate at least 300 days in most years, delivering approximately two million acre feet of water south to the pumps at Tracy where it would be pumped south to the new and expanded storage facilities.\",\n                \"There are several alternative ways to build this smaller system. One alternative is found with a careful look at the Delta map which reveals that two thirds of this Delta friendly system is already built. Two miles from the State Capital is the Port of Sacramento and the shipping channel that ends 25 miles south near Rio Vista. From there it is thirteen miles to existing channels and the Tracy pumps. The Federal Government already owns the land along the river where an intake and fish screen could be built, allowing 3000 cfs of Sacramento River water to enter the channel and flow south to a shipping lock at the southern end of the channel. Then, pumps could deliver the water into a short 12-mile pipe beneath the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and into the existing Delta channels that lead to the Tracy Pumps. The threatened Delta fish could be protected by sealing the channel from the Delta. Such a smaller facility is less costly than two 40-foot diameter, 40-mile long tunnels that devastate large swaths of the Delta and put the entire Delta at risk.\",\n                \"It is correct that this smaller facility like the twin tunnels is insufficient to quench the thirst of the Southern water contractors. This is where the southern reservoirs and the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp'' strategy comes into play. In normal water years there is sufficient water in the Delta to allow the pumps to take a big gulp of two million acre feet of water. This amount together with the two million acre feet delivered through the 3,000 cfs facility and the new water developed from conservation and recycling efforts could add up to six million acre feet. This plan would create far more new water than will ever be available with the current California Water Fix (BDCP) plan, which in its current state creates nothing new, except new destruction.\",\n                \"This small 3,000 cfs proposal and the current twin tunnel proposal envision the continued use of the existing Delta levee system as water conveyance channels for the delivery of water to the big pumps at Tracy. However, the California Water Fix (BDCP) has neither a plan nor funding for the maintenance of the levees that are crucial for their proposed water conveyance system. The Delta levees must be upgraded and maintained if water is to be transported through the Delta and if the Delta agriculture, infrastructure, ecology and people are to be protected.\",\n                \"No sane homeowner would go fifty years without maintaining their plumbing system. For more than fifty years, the Bureau of Reclamation and the California Department of Water Resources have used the Delta levees as a plumbing system to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. Yet, they have spent virtually no money maintaining these critical levees, the failure of which could shut down water deliveries for an extended period of time. The Federal and State agencies have relied upon the local reclamation agencies to do the repairs, literally giving the exporters a free ride. When a levee does give way and an island is flooded, it is the local agency and Federal and State governments that foot the bill to repair the levees, often at a much greater cost than would have been necessary with basic maintenance.\",\n                \"Legislation is necessary to require that the Federal and State water contractors, who have for years and will continue for even more years depended upon the Delta levees for the delivery of water to their fields and cities, pay a part of the levee maintenance cost.\",\n                \"The California Water Fix (BDCP) envisions restoring flood plains and the salt and freshwater marsh habitat of the Delta in an effort to restore the fisheries. However, a series of questions are raised: where to do it, how much to do, what type, at what cost and who is to pay for the restoration? Those who have created the ecological problem should pay for the restoration of the problem. All this will require careful attention to science, and a careful balance between competing goals. Current science indicates that no amount of habitat restoration can compensate for the damage done to fish from excessive water exports.\",\n                \"The California Water Fix (BDCP) and any other proposal must be based and driven by quality science that measures and informs decisions. California and federal law require that the Delta aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems be protected. We must do so, not just because the laws demand it, but because our status as human beings on this planet demands that we pay attention and protect precious and rare ecosystems. Also, healthy ecosystems provide a valuable asset to our communities because healthy ecosystems help to ensure we have healthy water. If we let the ecosystems fall by the wayside, our water will get dirtier making it increasingly difficult and costly to clean it up enough to use. For all of these reasons, we must let science govern.\",\n                \"The California Water Fix (BDCP) anticipates 50-year permits from state and federal agencies to allow incidental takes of endangered fish species. Once granted, the water exporters will have assurances that the project can take covered species and pump Delta water despite changes in the environment. To date, the California Water Fix (BDCP) has not built in flexibility to address the inevitable changes that will occur and the damage that could be done if the plan does not account for climate change.\",\n                \"We must also use science to understand our river basins in the age of climate change. Dams on California Rivers serve multiple purposes of water storage, flood protection, electric power generation, recreation, and environmental river flows. Current dam operations on California Rivers place flood protection as the first priority followed by water storage. The decisions to release water to create greater flood storage are based on the average river flows compiled from the last 60 years. Climate change and resulting river flow change is certain and one can only imagine how rare it will be for the historic average to actually occur.\",\n                \"We have the technology today to better understand what is happening, in real time, in every river basin in this state. Satellites and unmanned aircraft using infrared and ground sensing radar, together with terrestrial stations collecting soil conditions, snow temperature and moisture content coupled with telemetry will soon be deployed in the American River basin. Collecting this data and using it in real time to predict river flows allows for better operation of the dams so that additional flood storage capacity could be available by lowering the reservoir ahead of the storm or keeping water in the reservoir if a major storm is heading for a different river basin or if it is a cold snow storm. Using the best science can simultaneously deliver increased flood protection and greater water storage.\",\n                \"Soon after gold was discovered in California, the miners discovered that water could be used to separate gold from gravel and soon after, the right to the water flowing in the rivers became as valuable as the gold. Today, water is California's gold. The classic water war in California is usually about one group attempting to take another group's water. It is reasonable to view the current twin tunnels conflict in this way: southern exporters taking water belonging to northern water right holders and water necessary for the aquatic river environment. Any water plan that ignores the prior and existing water rights is destined to be embroiled in a vicious and contracted water war. If a project is to be built, then existing rights must be honored.\",\n                \"California must develop a comprehensive water program. The current California Water Fix (BDCP) is an outdated and destructive plumbing system. It does not create any new water. It does not provide the water and the ecological protection the Golden State must have. California and the federal government must set aside the big, expensive, destructive plumbing plan and immediately move forward with a comprehensive program that includes:\",\n                \"1) Conservation,\",\n                \"2) Recycling,\",\n                \"3) The creation of new storage systems,\",\n                \"4) Fix the Delta--right sized conveyance, levee improvements, and habitat restoration,\",\n                \"5) Science driven process,\",\n                \"6) Protection of existing water rights\",\n                \"California is once again embroiled in a water war. The California Water Fix/BDCP is not a comprehensive plan; it is a plumbing system that seeks to extract water from one part of the state and deliver it to another part. If history is any indication, water wars are expensive and fruitless. Only by embracing a comprehensive plan that creates new water for the entire state can we avoid gridlock and a water war. This paper presents a plan that emphasizes using the best available science and a portfolio of water projects to create a positive solution to the water challenge facing California. It's time to move forward and ensure a reliable water supply for the entire state.\",\n                \"Don't be fooled. The dreaded twin tunnels through the heart of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta did not die. The governor's new ``California Water Fix'' plan is the same destructive twin tunnel $17 billion boondoggle, just without the fig leaf cover of habitat restoration. Not one gallon of new water supply is created for our thirsty state. California water needs can be met with a comprehensive program that over the next 10 years can create more than 5 million acre-feet of new water at a cost no greater than the twin tunnels. Here are the keys to our water future: 1. Conservation 2. Recycling/desalinization 3. Creation of new surface and aquifer storage 4. Science-driven process 5. Fixing the Delta--right-sized conveyance, levee improvements and habitat restoration Go forward carefully; start small; use science to evaluate each step; then proceed to the next step. The Delta is a unique and precious environmental asset. First, reduce demand on the Delta with water conservation, recycling and desalinization, and strategic use of surface and aquifer storage. Move forward with habitat improvements for the floodplain and fresh and saltwater marshes. Repair and improve the key Delta levees. Evaluate the effect on the Delta as these projects come online. Then, and only if necessary, proceed with a conveyance system that is much smaller and with a reduced capacity to destroy. A much smaller facility with a capacity of no more than 3,000 cubic feet per second could be built to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. With the normal minimum flows in the Sacramento River above 15,000 cubic feet per second, a 3,000-cfs facility could operate at least 300 days in most years, delivering about 2 million acre feet of water to the pumps at Tracy and on south to new and expanded storage facilities. Half of this Delta-friendly system is already built. Two miles from the state Capitol is the Port of Sacramento. A fish screen could be built at the existing opening on the Sacramento River, allowing 3,000 cubic feet per second of Sacramento River water to enter the deep water channel and flow 25 miles south to a shipping lock at the southern end of the channel. Then, pumps could deliver the water into a 12- mile pipe beneath the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and into a new aqueduct alongside the Old River channel that leads to the Tracy pumps. An alternative route could take the water out at the southern end of the shipping channel, delivering it into an aqueduct around the town of Rio Vista, across the Sacramento River at Sherman Island and through Contra Costa County to the Tracy pumps. This route would intersect six vital San Francisco Bay aqueducts, thus creating a safety system for 8 million Bay residents. The ``Little Sip, Big Gulp'' strategy completes the program to meet California's future water needs. In normal water years, there is sufficient water in the Delta to allow the pumps to take a ``big gulp'' of 2 million acre-feet of water. This amount together with the 2 million acre-feet delivered through the 3,000-cfs facility would meet the annual water demand south of the Delta. The new water developed from surface and underground storage, conservation, and recycling and desalinization efforts could add up to 5 million acre-feet, and together with an eco-friendly Delta solution would be enough to serve the future needs of a thriving California. \"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/06/24/E970_california-drought/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"D\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-06-24\",\n            \"bills\": [\n                \"H.R. 1837\"\n            ],\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"G000559\",\n            \"pages\": \"E970-E973\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"Garamendi\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. garamendi\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": \"OH\",\n            \"speaker_first\": \"John\",\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"A SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING TO GOD FOR THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE JAMES C.

May God grant us grace in this time that in pain we may find comfort, in sorrow we may find joy, and in death, resurrection. Let's pray. Our gracious and loving God, we bow in awe of Your greatness and Your love. You have spoken words of life to us in so many ways. You've given form and beauty to our world, and all of creation sings Your praise. You have given us one another to love and receive love, a reflection of Your gracious love for us. And You have spoken to us in the words of Scripture and in Jesus, the Word made flesh, the Author of life. As You speak to us now, in this service of worship, help us once again to hear Your words of life as we celebrate the life and legacy of Your servant, Jim. In Jesus' name. Amen. I invite you now to turn in your worship guide to the words of the 23rd Psalm as we say them together: ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. ``He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. ``He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. ``Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. ``Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. ``Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. The words of Psalm 46: ``God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the Earth should change, though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea; though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble with its tumult. ``There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it shall not be moved; God will help it when the morning dawns. The nations are in an uproar, the kingdoms totter; He utters His voice, the Earth melts. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. ``Come, behold the works of the Lord; see what desolations He has brought on the Earth. He makes wars cease to the end of the Earth; He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear; He burns the shields with fire. `Be still, and know that I am God! I am exalted among the nations; I am exalted in the Earth.' The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.'' The words of the prophet Micah: `` `With what shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old. Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' ``He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?'' God speaks to us in the reading of Scripture. Solo--``Let There Be Peace on Earth'' performed by Mr. Christopher Auchter. (The Honorable Martin Frost, United States House of Representatives, 24th District of Texas, 1979-2005) Mr. Frost: Well, in the words of President John F. Kennedy about Jim Wright: No city in America was better represented in Congress than Fort Worth. I'm here today to speak on behalf of the scores of people-- many of whom, Texans--that Jim Wright helped along the way with their careers. He was our mentor, our colleague, and our friend. And we were better public servants because of Jim Wright, and many of those Members, past and present, Democrat and Republican, are here with us today to honor Jim. In a minute, I'm going to speak about what Jim did for my career, but it really speaks volumes for what he did for a lot of others, too. Jim Wright was an extraordinary leader both for the people of Fort Worth and for our Nation. He always remembered the people who sent him to Washington and worked tirelessly to make our country even better every day he was in office. Few Congressmen in recent times have had a greater impact than our friend Jim Wright. I met Jim Wright 57 years ago, in 1958, when he was a young Congressman beginning his second term and I was a 16-year- old. Jim was the guest speaker at the Temple Beth-El youth group in the basement of the old synagogue building on West Broadway, near downtown. I had never met a national politician before, and he made a deep impression on me that day. I remember to this day some of what he said, and more of that a little bit later. Seven years later, in 1965, I showed up in Washington as a young reporter covering Congress for a magazine, and the first thing I did was to go see my hometown Congressman, Jim Wright. Jim and his chief of staff, Marshall Lynam, were very helpful to this young reporter, suggesting who I should get to know on congressional committee staffs. Three years later, in the summer of 1968, Jim helped me get a job on Hubert Humphrey's national Presidential campaign staff while I was a student at Georgetown Law School. The last two people I saw before I headed back to Texas following graduation in 1970 were Jim and Marshall. I told them that I hoped to come back to D.C. some day as a Congressman--in a neighboring district. I had no intention of ever running against Jim Wright. Fast forward to 1976 when I was north Texas coordinator of the Carter-Mondale Presidential campaign. The Carter campaign wanted to come to Texas the weekend before the general election when carrying Texas was still in doubt. They wanted to only stop in Dallas. As a Fort Worth boy, I told them they also had to come to Cowtown and that I knew that local Congressman Jim Wright would put on one hell of a show for them, and that's exactly what Jim did. He filled the downtown convention center with more than 10,000 people early in the afternoon that Sunday. It made great television, and Carter became the last Democratic Presidential candidate to carry Texas. Shortly after that election, Jim Wright became House majority leader by one vote in a hotly contested secret ballot election. He certainly knew how to count. Two years later, I was elected to Congress from the 24th District, which, in fact, adjoined the 12th District that Jim represented. Jim went to Speaker Tip O'Neill and made sure I was named to the powerful House Rules Committee, an appointment that almost never went to a freshman Member. From that day on, Jim Wright and I became both colleagues and friends. He was my mentor during the 11 years we served together, and I learned an enormous amount just watching him in action. And when I inherited the Black community in southeast Fort Worth following the 1991 redistricting, I only used one picture in my mailing: a photo of Jim Wright and me. There wasn't anything else the voters in that part of my district needed to know. They continued to be my base for the remainder of my 26 years in Congress, and just to make sure people in Fort Worth knew that I had strong ties to Fort Worth, even though I now lived in Dallas, he used to tell anyone who would listen that I went to high school in his district in Fort Worth's Paschal, and he went to high school in my district in Dallas' Adamson. When Jim taught a course at TCU on Congress for 20 years after leaving the Congress, I was proud to be a guest lecturer for him every single year. The last time I saw Jim was in the spring of 2014, when I was working on a book about Congress. We visited for about an hour in his office at TCU. His body was frail, but his mind was as sharp as ever. I learned how to be an effective Congressman by observing Jim as a colleague and as a junior partner on a variety of matters that helped Fort Worth. He never forgot the people who sent him to Washington. He was a stalwart in his work on behalf of defense workers at what is now Lockheed Martin, which was General Dynamics, and Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth. He played a significant role in the decision by American Airlines to move its corporate headquarters from New York to the Metroplex, and he was a strong supporter of DFW airport, the jobs magnet for this part of the State. We worked together--and by the way, he did the heavy lifting--to convince the railroad to make its right-of-way available for the Trinity River Express connecting Fort Worth and Dallas. No request from anyone in Tarrant County was too small to win Jim's help. Also, Jim's role in promoting the careers of promising African Americans from Fort Worth was of great significance. He brought Lorraine Miller, a young woman from the southeast side of Fort Worth, to Washington to work on his staff. Years later, she became the first African American to serve as Clerk of the U.S. House and recently served as interim national president of the NAACP. And just a few years ago, Jim played a key role in the election of Mark Veasey, who became the first Black Congressman from Fort Worth. One of Jim's greatest strengths was molding a disparate group of Democrats into an effective majority when he became Speaker. During his first year as Speaker in 1987--and Tony and Steny, you will remember this--Congress passed all 13 appropriation bills before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, something that is almost never done today. I remember his response to a question from the audience at that speech at Temple Beth-El in 1958. He was asked what a Congressman does when he feels one way about an issue and his district feels the other way. He responded that the job of a Congressman was to reflect the views of his district as often as he could. He then added that he reserved a small percentage of votes, perhaps 10 percent, to vote against the majority of his district if he felt something was vital in the national interest. And he then added that it was his responsibility to go back to his constituents to explain his vote and hopefully convince them that he was right and they were wrong. He added that if a Congressman couldn't successfully do that, he wouldn't be reelected, and that was as it should be. He did a very good job following his own advice. I did the same and found that he was exactly correct. Fort Worth is a great city today because of Jim Wright. We all owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. We will never see his like again. (The Honorable Bill Alexander, United States House of Representatives, First District of Arkansas, 1969-1993) Mr. Alexander: Jimmy and Ginger, Kerry, Lisa, and all the Wright family, I feel that we are kin. And to all of his friends who are here today, I join you in tribute to one of my dearest friends. I kept up with Jim through the years, even after he left Washington and returned to Texas; and following his recovery from surgery, I gave him a call one day, and he invited me to come to Fort Worth. So my son and I--Alex, who is here--with his sister Ashley, who came to TCU at a later time, boarded our plane and came to DFW. At those days, Jim was driving, and so he met us at the airport. I'd never been outside of DFW before, so I didn't know what to expect. And so as we left the terminal, I noticed all of the concrete infrastructure that supports the airport: the entrance ramps, the exit ramps, the overhead bridges, the long ride to the interstate. I never saw so much concrete in all my life. So I turned to Jim, who at one time, as most of you know, was chairman of the Public Works Committee, and I said to him, ``Jim, how much money did the Public Works Committee spend on this airport?'' And he looked at me and rolled his brow and lifted his big bushy eyebrows and he said to me, ``Not a penny more than the law allowed.'' Jim was probably one of the most successful chairmen in Congress; and with that success, people encouraged him, and he ran for majority leader. As all of you probably followed in the news, it was a very contentious race, and on the day of the vote, I was appointed to be a judge. And so after the votes were cast, I adjourned with the other members of the election group and counted the votes. We counted them twice, and Jim won by one vote. I got up from the chair in the Speaker's lounge--the Speaker's lobby, we call it--rushed through the door to the House Chamber, and Jim was sitting on the second row on the Democratic side in the Hall of the House. I rushed up to him and I said, ``Jim, you won.'' He was surprised because no one knew the outcome of that election. He looked at me, and he said, ``Are you sure?'' And I said, ``Jim, I counted the votes, and if you hadn't won, Phil Burton said he would send me to Alaska.'' Following in the footsteps of Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson, Jim asserted leadership in Congress at a time of confusion in the Senate and the White House, demonstrating a unique ability to command our Nation's political resources to get things done. And this went across the aisle to the Republicans and even down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, which is a million miles away if you serve in Congress sometimes. Jim Wright had fought in World War II to defend the values of the Greatest Generation, as Tom Brokaw describes this generation, a generation of men and women united in common purposes of family, country, duty, honor, courage, and service. During World War II, he flew many combat missions. I haven't really been able to discern exactly how many yet because there's such a debate over it. Maybe somebody will tell me before I go back to Washington. And he served as a bombardier and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery. Jim believed that government should serve the people as well as the economic interests, which also must be represented, and provide Federal assistance to communities and States like Arkansas, where I'm from. It's in need of capital development in order to provide infrastructure to try to attract industry and jobs for our people. That was, in his view, providing building blocks for the foundation of the economic development that benefits all of us. All you've got to do is look around in Texas a little bit to find out if it works. The criticism of Speaker Wright, which is in the news, instead of all of the accomplishments that we know he achieved, his strong leadership came from a changing Congress. Some of my former colleagues from Congress are here today, and they know what I'm talking about. Beginning with the 1968 election, which was my first election to Congress, the ideals and values of the Greatest Generation began to evolve. A Congress run by Southern Democrats, who chaired mostly the important committees in the Congress, was gradually replaced by a younger generation of Congressmen and Senators, many of them in the other party. And when he left Congress, even his political enemies often remarked that, had he stayed in Congress, he would have been the greatest Speaker since Henry Clay. His time as Speaker laid down historic markers. He was the last great figure in Congress to keep alive the idea of development--that came from the New Deal--that would help our economy. After him came what we call Reaganomics and the tidal wave of polarization of our two political parties and the continuing mindless cannibalism which we can still see evident today between the parties and even in the parties in Congress. Criticism of Speaker Wright's forceful leadership came from Republicans and Democrats alike; although, at the time he stepped down, the principal antagonists came from within our own party. I was there, and I know who they are. What followed was a profound change in the power structure in Congress, shifting away from the power and authority lodged in a handful of key Southern committee chairmen to a dispersion of power among proliferating committees and subcommittees, encouraging intensifying rivalries and even political fratricides throughout the House. His departure marked the end of an era when Southern Democrats dominated in both the House and the Senate, along with a gradual evolution of the Congress toward social issues. It marked the transition from Southern leadership of Congress to a growing concentration of power of the Democratic Party in our Nation's biggest cities, many of them in the North, opening a widening rift between our Nation's small towns and rural areas and the political interests of the inner cities. The way was opened for lobbyists to shift attention away from schools and roads and bridges and water systems that helped our people to special interests of Wall Street banks and a commercial agenda. A fluent speaker of Spanish, he took the initiative to intervene in the political crisis in Nicaragua and crafted peace talks that laid the foundation for elections. When I assisted him in this so-called ``junket,'' in his endeavor I found that what we tried to do generated much consternation among President Reagan's White House staff. Later, another great Texan, James Baker, observed that what Jim Wright did with his intervention in Nicaragua turned the corner for that nation and helped the U.S. and Nicaragua to come to better terms with one another. Jim Wright was not only a master of the political structure and the rules in Congress, he also was an author, a professor. He lectured at Texas Christian University with eagerness to inspire and guide our Nation's youth. In the tradition of Sam Houston and Sam Rayburn, Jim Wright was a giant. I was his chief deputy whip in the Congress, the worst job in the House of Representatives, but it was worth all the knocks and the cuts and the bruises and the criticism that I endured to fight for the values established by the Greatest Generation until the ideals were changed by a new breed of voter who believes that Washington is not a solution, rather, Washington is the problem. He was my dear friend, and I stood with him in every fight for the values that won World War II and provided the building blocks and foundation for the greatest economy on Earth. God bless Jim Wright. (Mr. Paul Driskell, Special Assistant, Majority Leader James C. Wright, Jr.) Mr. Driskell: Martin, Bill, Betsy, Mike, Kenneth, Mr. Leader, Steny Hoyer--the one man in this sanctuary today who knows the full weight and measure and the responsibilities of the job this prince of peace executed so beautifully for so many years. Dear Steny, thank you for your presence today. How very, very special, how honored he would be, how much he would love this congregation today. This is a delegation of community builders. Mr. Wright loved Sam Rayburn dearly, and he often quoted him; and of course many people wondered why Mr. Rayburn went back to Bonham, Texas, after announcing he was going to leave the House, and his answer was simple: Bonham, Texas: the people there know when you're sick, and they care when you die. You have validated Jim Wright's recitation of that quote, all of you today, by honoring him in coming here. You knew he was ill, and you cared that he died. Oh, how he would celebrate you. Oh, how he must be enjoying this. He loved people of accomplishment. He loved people who contributed and built. Mr. Rayburn used to always say: A jackass can kick a barn down; it takes a carpenter to build one. It's no accident that our Lord was fathered by a carpenter--and parented by a carpenter in his early years. I'd like to give you a sense of Speaker Wright, Jim Wright, and my friend. It may be very, very unique. And as I have thought about him so much and as I visited him in those final days, things came to me that I would have never imagined. He was, in fact, the first gifted multitasker. Now, if you know anything about Jim, he despised anything to do with technology, but he was a multitasker. Let me explain what I mean. February 7, 1985, 11 o'clock in the morning, after about 30 days, some of the people in this room--Tony, John--had been working diligently because Mr. O'Neill had told us privately he was going to retire. So we were trying to collect the requisite number of votes for him to become Speaker of the House 2 years out. February 7, 1985, 11 o'clock in the morning, a national press conference was held in the office that Steny Hoyer's offices are in today. He met the national press. He was surrounded by his colleagues. He was surrounded by people who loved him and wished well for him, and he made the announcement that he had achieved the requisite number of votes to capture his dream, to be Speaker of the House. He put a peace, if you will, in a body that's not given to peace easily about the next years and how things would follow. Fifteen minutes later, he grabbed me by the arm and escorted me and my wife, Donna, up the back stairs with 31 other people to the House Chaplain's office where Chaplain Ford married us at Henry Clay's desk, the great compromiser. And then, he walked back downstairs with us. We had a reception in the office. He pulled Donna and me aside and he said, ``I only have two things to tell you two: Paul, always hold her hand, and never go to bed mad.'' Mr. Speaker, sometimes you set the bar too high. I have removed pillows from my bed so as not to elevate the temptation for Donna to smother me. There are so many things privately that I loved about him and that we shared. He had a passionate love for boxing. He knew boxing. He knew boxing like Nat Fleischer, the famous author who recorded almost everything of significance about American heavyweight boxing. We went to a fight. We went to Golden Gloves. We went to the Olympic trials. We went to tons of professional fights. It was like going to that fight with Nat Fleischer, and he would be sitting there and he would be reciting to you the ring scores of the Firpo-Dempsey fight. He knew--every--every hobby and interest he had, he wanted to know everything there was to know about it. If you ever saw the roses that he cultivated, you'd understand that in spades. He was a gifted horticulturist. He was a great teacher. Kay, you and I sat just about where Steny was sitting 2 years ago, 2\\\\1/2\\\\ years ago, and you told me how he taught you and Ginger, Jenny and Lisa about God. In fact, he used a wagon wheel and said that was the universe and God was, indeed, the hub; and the spokes represented the people, and, of course, the rim, where all the damage and impact takes place, was the furthest from God. And he admonished you that it was your job, it was your responsibility, it was a testament of your faith to move closer down those spokes because you would be closer to more people, and as you were closer to more people, you'd be closer to God. What a gift. I've often wondered, and I think everyone in this sanctuary today wonders, why God lets us see certain things at certain times. It seems rather odd. Last week, just the day before his passing and only a few days after my last visit with him, there was a documentary on about George Foreman. I happened to turn it on the other night. George Foreman, the famous heavyweight, struck fear and terror in everyone's heart-- undefeated, knocked poor Joe Frazier down eight times. And the interviewer asked him a question. He said, ``Who was the greatest champion of all time in your estimation?'' And George Foreman didn't hesitate. He said, ``Muhammad Ali.'' That stunned the interviewer. Muhammad Ali had defeated George Foreman in Zaire, Africa, and usually when a boxer loses to another one, it was a lucky punch or you're just a little better that night, not the greatest champion that ever lived. He didn't hesitate. He said, ``Muhammad Ali.'' The interviewer said, ``Why? Why do you choose him?'' He said, ``Well, if you saw the fight in the eighth round, he hit me twice in the face.'' And if any of you remember or happened to have seen it, George Foreman began to cartwheel. He began to turn and fall to the floor. And as he was falling, Muhammad Ali, as all boxers are trained all their life to do, cocked his arm to hit him with what is known as the ``killing punch.'' And George Foreman said, ``I looked up out of my left eye, just partially conscious, knowing I was going to the floor, and he never threw that punch. So for me, he's not the greatest champion that ever lived for the punches he threw; it's for what he didn't do. It's the punch he didn't throw.'' And the very people who besmirched and impugned this prince of peace at the end of his public career, when they fell on hard times and they fell by the sword they had so recklessly wielded, not once in private--and certainly never in public-- did Jim Wright throw that punch. He could not retaliate. He didn't just talk Christian forgiveness; he lived it. His higher calling at that time was to find a way to inspire students at TCU to engage in public service and to think about the possibilities of what they could build, like the beautiful people in this room today. He didn't throw that punch. I was 15 years old, standing in front of a black-and-white TV, and I watched Robert Kennedy say, ``When he shall die, take him and cut him out into stars, and he shall make the face of Heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish Sun.'' I didn't know at 15 just what that meant. At 65, I marvel how Bobby Kennedy could have mustered the strength and the insight to say that about the brother he loved, in some ways his best friend, and, oh, by the way, in passing, the President of the United States. I understood because of this church and because of my association with him that all of us have a spark of divinity. We are all made in God's image, and that spark is there, but what I didn't understand was that there are a special few who possess a flame, a torch. It's bigger. It's more committed. It's something we can appreciate. It's not necessarily something we readily understand. It's not by accident that there's an eternal flame that burns at John Kennedy's grave and why, for all the accomplishments: the Peace Corps, the space program, all of those things--no. That's part of it. That's why millions go there to pay respects. The part of it is that during the most sensitive time in our Nation's history, when we were the closest to engaging in a nuclear holocaust, when every adviser that that President had was admonishing him to take advantage of the tactical and strategic position we occupied for those precious few days and strike Cuba with nuclear weapons, he didn't throw that punch. And we're all breathing good air and loving our friends and conducting our lives because of that divine torch. The thing I think I will miss most is a private passion that Jim had and I shared. He loved movies. The singular thing that we really appreciated together was we happened to think that Robert Duvall was the greatest American actor that's ever lived. Jim's favorite movie was ``Tender Mercies,'' and my favorite film was ``The Natural.'' And in ``The Natural,'' there's a scene--of course, all the ladies in here know Robert Redford was the natural. He was Roy Hobbs, the gifted baseball player. Robert Duvall was the cynical sportswriter; Wilford Brimley was the crusty old coach. And there's that beautiful soliloquy where the coach walks in and he says--I mean, pardon me, Robert Duvall walks in and says to the coach, ``Coach, who is this Roy Hobbs?'' And the coach turns on his heels and says, ``I don't know who Roy Hobbs is. I just know he's the best there is and the best there ever will be.'' Jim Wright, you are the natural. There probably has never been a man in American history who I can recall that so eloquently used the English language. He helped those of us who only have sparks appreciate the flame with his application of our language. And it seems a shame that I can't find words in my language to encompass all that he was, and yet he will always be. Only in Spanish: Vaya con Dios--go and be with God. Light of our land. Vaya con Dios, friend of my life. Congregational Hymn--``This is My Song'' Reverend Bruster: I invite you to hear now the words of the Apostle Paul from the first letter to the Corinthians, Chapter 13: ``If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. ``Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. ``Love never ends.'' And Paul ends that chapter with the words: ``And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.'' The words of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, a sermon on the plain: ``But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat, do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you. ``If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.'' Jim had a wonderful, quick wit as we all know. His responses to glowing introductions illustrated that point. Two years ago, when Cissy Day was introducing him to a Sunday school class where he was about to speak, she told a story at the end of her introduction of something that he had done that was very kind and a note that he had written to her that was a kind note that she treasured. When he stood up then to speak, he looked over at her and he said, ``Uh, I had forgotten how nice I used to be.'' After a glowing introduction at another event, he said, ``An event of this dimension is just terribly hard on one's humility. Try as I might to look and sound humble, I just can't quite pull it off.'' And then he quoted Jesus: ``Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.'' And he said, ``You know, when I read that, I realized he doesn't say, `Let your light so shine so that others may see your good works and think what a great guy.' '' And then he went on to say, ``The purpose of good works is not to get bragged on.'' But then he said this: ``But if I'm honest with you, I guess I'm going to have to let you in on a little personal confession. Being bragged on, I like it,'' he said. ``I eat it up.'' And on another occasion, he said after an introduction, ``Undeserved as though an introduction like that is, indeed I want you to know that I liked it. I liked every word of it.'' And then he said, ``There are two kinds of people who appreciate flattery: men and women.'' So since Jim made that confession, I guess it's okay that we tell of his good works and that we laud him. And I hope that he would appreciate that we do it not just pointing at Jim, but pointing at the source of all of that for Jim; pointing not just to Jim, but beyond to the legacy that he received from other people, and beyond Jim to his faith and his commitment to Christ that guided his life. He leaves a great legacy, and our words hold up those great attributes not to point just to Jim, but to also point to his faith and commitment and the One in whom he had faith and the One that he sought to follow, and also to see Jim's life as an example to all of us. I want to think about that with you for just a few minutes. Jim was an encourager. As he sought to be a follower of Christ and as he put that into practice in his life, he knew the importance of encouragement. He was an encourager. In the book of Acts, we meet a man named Joseph. He was from Cyprus. But we don't know him as Joseph. We almost never hear that. After his first introduction in the book of Acts, he's known by his nickname, and his nickname was Barnabas. The disciples, the apostles, nicknamed him Barnabas because Barnabas means ``son of encouragement.'' He was an encourager. Imagine having your nickname mean one who encourages. We could call Jim that, a Barnabas, because he was. He was a son of encouragement. How many of us in this room, I wonder, have, in our possession, notes of encouragement from Jim Wright? I would guess a lot of us. Those notes arrived at a time of discouragement, perhaps, or a time of grief or a time of uncertainty or a time of failing confidence or a time of waning courage. A note of encouragement arrived at just the right time. What is the value of those notes? I was thinking about that and thought, you know, the law of supply and demand would say those notes are not worth anything at all; there are too many of them on the market. But the value of those notes goes far beyond that. They're valued in a different way. One person told me that she had such a note in a plastic sleeve and carried it with her for a long time. What an encourager, not just the notes, but the right words spoken at the right moment. We give thanks to God for Jim because Jim was a peacemaker, and we have heard our speakers talk eloquently about his peacemaking efforts. He often quoted Jesus, again, from the Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. And he was a peacemaker. He was a man of strong convictions but yet able to see and to respect the perspective of another and to bring people together in ways that make for peace. He was, as a peacemaker, a child of God, as Jesus said. Now, peacemaking extended beyond what you may know about to his role as a parent. His daughters, Ginger and Kay, were fighting one time as sisters do, and Jim intervened as the peacemaker. And he made each one of them go to her room and write an essay, entitled, ``Why I Love My Sister.'' And he held on to those essays for 30 years, and then he gave them back to the girls so they could read them. Kay wrote this: ``Well, I suppose she's nice. Her friends seem to like her.'' Ginger wrote: ``Well, she seems to like my clothes because she wears them all the time.'' He closed the door after reading those essays and guffawed, as you can imagine. Ginger's comment, when she was telling me about it, was, ``And he thought the Sandinistas and Contras were tough.'' Jim was a servant leader; we know that. His accomplishments were many. In serving his beloved Weatherford and his beloved Fort Worth and his beloved Nation, he was a servant leader. Whether that was as a father, a grandfather, a great- grandfather, a soldier, a State legislator, a Scout master, a golden gloves boxing coach, a Sunday school teacher, a church leader, a mayor, a Congressman, a majority leader, a Speaker of the House, a teacher, or a friend, he was a servant leader--again, following the words of Jesus that we are to be servants of one another if we're ever to be called great. His life was committed to compassion and justice. I read those wonderful words from Micah a moment ago. Micah was writing to a nation, to his people, who had lost their way, who had lost sight of that which was most important. They had the right words. They had the right rituals. But Micah wrote that that was all empty and reminded them of what was most important that they should have known already. He said, ``What has he told you, O mortal, but what is good, and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.'' On so many occasions, I saw Jim share his faith; I saw Jim share his values, heard him speak in this pulpit. A number of years ago--I think it was in 2006--my wife, Susan, who was working at William James Middle School as academic coordinator, shared that with Jim, and he said, ``I used to go to William James Middle School.'' And she invited him then to come and speak to the students, and she had Jim Wright Day, and he spent most of the day at the school. And he talked with those students, and he had a reception in the library where he shared with them. There was a big assembly in the auditorium, and it's one of those old classic schools with a big auditorium, a balcony in the back, and it was packed with middle school kids. And I couldn't believe my eyes and my ears when he spoke to them. You could hear a pin drop. He was a master. And he shared with those kids the story of the Good Samaritan. I remember how he started into that. He said, ``There are a lot of different beliefs.'' He said, ``There is a man who lived a long time ago. His name was Jesus. He was a very good man, and a lot of different people believed a lot of different things about him. But he told some stories that taught some important values, and everybody agrees on that,'' he said. He told the story of the Good Samaritan. You know the story. The man is beaten and robbed, lying on the side of the road. Along come two people who pass by on the other side, and then comes the Samaritan who is the outsider in the story, and he's the one who helps the man. And I remember Jim said to those kids, ``This illustrates really three philosophies of life, the three ways of approaching life.'' He said, ``There is the philosophy of the thieves, and their philosophy is what's yours is mine, and I'll take it.'' He said, ``That philosophy still lives in attacking others and cheating people and greedy business practices and being envious of others and whatever belittles or injures or degrades another person. It's not always physically violent,'' he said. He said, ``We rob others by slander or gossip when we injure their reputations.'' And he said, ``The second philosophy is that of the two men who saw the wounded man but offered no help.'' He said, ``Their central operating principle is what is mine is all mine, and I'll keep it for myself.'' He said, ``That's less violent, but in its own way it's as selfish as the first.'' He said, ``We can come up with all kinds of excuses to justify not helping those injured along life's highway. We deceive ourselves and ignore their suffering by saying that they're not our responsibility.'' Then he said, ``Then there's the Samaritan. This was Jesus' model for humanity. He was a stranger and a child of another religious heritage, but he extended himself freely to help one in need. And his philosophy is what's mine is yours if you need it, and I'll share it with you.'' And then he said, ``Jesus told that story in answer to a question. The question was, Who is my neighbor?'' And then he told those kids, ``There are these three philosophies of life, and there's only one that makes the world a better place. There's only one that makes your relationships better, and it's that of the Samaritan. And we each can choose how we live.'' Now, that illustrates so much how Jim lived and how he wanted to pass on that legacy to those who came after him. Much has been spoken about his ability to forgive, and I cannot but think, as we meditate on those words of Jesus, the words of Paul about love, Jesus' words about forgiveness, and I can't help but think of the quote that he often gave from Abraham Lincoln. Someone once asked Lincoln if he believed in destroying his enemies, and Lincoln replied, ``Of course, I would like to destroy my enemies because I've never wanted enemies. The only way I know satisfactorily to destroy an enemy is to convert him to a friend.'' The Fetzer Institute has done a lot of research on forgiveness, and they define it in a way that I think is so meaningful, and that is, forgiveness is the difficult, intentional process of letting go of an old reality and opening up one's self to a new one. And Jim lived that difficult, intentional process of being able to let go of an old reality and opening up and living a new one. One friend emailed me and said, ``He was the poster child for amazing grace.'' That's the legacy that we celebrate today, and there's so much more that could be said. The challenge for all of us today was how do we winnow it down. But you know what? You carry those stories of Jim; you carry those memories; you carry that legacy. Share it; share it with one another; and do your best. Let us all do our best to live it--to live it. In the obituary that you were handed as you came in, there is a favorite quote of his from Horace Greeley: ``Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wings, those who cheer today may curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures--character.'' Well done, Jim Wright, good and faithful servant. Let's pray. Gracious God, we give You thanks for the hope that faith in You gives. For all Your people who have laid hold on that hope, especially we thank You for Your faithful servant Jim Wright. We thank You for all Your goodness to him and for everything in his life that was a reflection of Your love and Your grace. We give You thanks for his faith, for his love for and his commitment to You and to his family and to his friends, to his Nation. We give You thanks for his kindness, his passion for justice, his courage, and his strength of character. Loving God, hold us and all who mourn in Your love, and comfort this loving family and comfort us, his friends. Help us all to be ever mindful of Your sustaining presence. We offer a prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. In just a few moments, the family will process out, and you're invited to Wesley Hall, which is across the garden in that adjacent part of the building, for a reception with the family. Please note the instructions that are on the back of your bulletin, and I invite you to please remain seated, if you will, until the ushers direct you. Ginger shared with me one of her favorite memories of opening of the Presidential display, the new Presidential display in the early 1990s, a room turned into a replica of LBJ's office there in Austin. There was an antique pump organ there signed by all the Members of Congress, and Jake Pickle sat down at the organ and started playing a hymn. And the congressional Members and former Members there started singing the hymn, and it's the hymn that we're going to sing in just a moment after Jim's great-grandchildren give us our benediction. A benediction isn't really a prayer. It can be a prayer of course, but traditionally, it is not. The word ``benediction'' literally means ``a good word.'' The great- grandchildren, led by the oldest, Campbell, will give us their good word. Will you come now. (Campbell Brown, Jim Wright's great-granddaughter, and Jim Wright's great-grandchildren) Miss Brown: Hi, my name is Campbell Brown. Everyone on stage with me is a great-grandchild of Jim Wright or, as we like to call him, ``Great Pop.'' None of us were born when he was in Congress, but we all knew his love for this great country, especially Fort Worth. We are told by many people that he often said, ``I want to make the world a better place for my children, their children, and their children's children.'' Well, that's us. Next to me are the children of the grandchildren. We are the next generation. We would like to ask you to honor our Great Pop for the rest of the day by thinking about how you can make the world a better place. As you walk out of the church and for the rest of today, think about peace, not war; think about abundance, not scarcity; think about love, not hate, and hope, not despair. Please help us lift Great Pop to his next roll call by singing the final hymn. Thank y'all for coming today.

It is a downpour. For those of us from California, it has been a long time since we have seen a downpour.\",\n                \"The Golden State, the seventh largest economy in the world and home to over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. This is the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in California.\",\n                \"The economy is moving along. We are not complaining about the economy. Many parts of it are moving along. But for everyone in the State of California, whether you are in the far north up near Mount Shasta or way down here in the San Diego area, we are hurting.\",\n                \"There is a lot of talk. Water restrictions are taking place in every city, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far south at Laguna Beach. Wherever you happen to be in the State of California, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of communities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more important in some communities, to even live there.\",\n                \"In some parts of the Central Valley, down here in the Fresno area, there are communities that are out of water. Communities of 3,000, 5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all.\",\n                \"This is a problem today. As we look to the future, we are going to see the State's economy and population grow and the demand for water will ever increase, unless we do something. What we must do is develop a water plan for all of California.\",\n                \"Unfortunately, what we do most of the time in California is fight over water. There is the famous saying from Mark Twain: ``Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over.''\",\n                \"And so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to California in the early days of the Gold Rush up here in the mother lode region. You couldn't mine without water. And fighting over that water was the order of the day, and it is today.\",\n                \"So as this entire State and much of the Southwest region--Nevada, southern Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and even the western parts of Texas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting in California. And I want to spend a few moments this evening talking about what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the State of California.\",\n                \"Immediate, we are going to have to seek help. The State of California is using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from the historic passage of Proposition 1 last November to immediately try to fix problems that exist in those communities without water. And so that money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they happen to be.\",\n                \"There are a couple up here in the Sacramento Valley and further down in the San Joaquin Valley. The deserts have always been without water, so this is not new to them, although it is more extreme.\",\n                \"It is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the rest of the short-term solutions will come from Washington. I want to congratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of money for a variety of projects. Some of those projects are to dig deeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to improve the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs that are short-term in nature--all to the good. And that should continue.\",\n                \"In the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill for water. In that appropriations bill, we should direct the administration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through this drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the immediate drought that is occurring.\",\n                \"Whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no difference. It is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up with Proposition 1 of the last November ballot. That is both short-term and long-term. So the Federal Government supports those projects that would be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of California voted for in an overwhelming majority.\",\n                \"But I would also like to talk about the long-term here. Because droughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in California, but across the West.\",\n                \"For many years, the Department of Water Resources in California has looked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until about 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a comprehensive plan.\",\n                \"I am familiar with this. I am a water warrior in California. I have represented this part of California for nearly 40 years, the great Central Valley of California. I will put up another map so you can get a better look at it.\",\n                \"So the plans that were put together by the California Department of Water Resources deal with the Sacramento River, which flows south, and the San Joaquin River, which flows north from the Fresno area. This is way beyond Sacramento. Mount Shasta and Oregon, it is way up there.\",\n                \"These are the two great rivers of California, together with the Colorado, which is way to the south. It flows into an area here which is called the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is the largest estuary of the Western Hemisphere, which is on the West Coast. From Alaska to Chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish and species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of California.\",\n                \"As this water flows down the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, it is collected here and pumped south into the San Joaquin Valley and over the Tehachapi Mountains way down here to southern California. That is the Great Southern water project and the Federal water project.\",\n                \"But the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the environment of the delta, Suisun Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Along with it, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those projects.\",\n                \"So what are we to do? We will take the information that has been developed over these many years by the California Department of Water Resources and develop a comprehensive plan.\",\n                \"One plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that would take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down here at Tracy. That plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the fifties, was taken up by our current Governor, Governor Jerry Brown, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was called the Peripheral Canal--peripheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps.\",\n                \"I represented the delta at that time, and I said: Governor, what you have managed to create here is the great vampire ditch.\",\n                \"The Peripheral Canal was big enough to take the water from the Sacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for its environment, and deliver it to the pumps.\",\n                \"So we had another great water war. It actually went on the ballot, and the people of California decided not to build that canal. And so there it sat until the second iteration of our current Governor, and he decided it was time to address this problem.\",\n                \"And so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground so nobody can see it. He said: Don't worry about the canal. Don't worry. You will never see it.\",\n                \"I said: Because it is not going to get built?\",\n                \"He said: No, no. Because it will be underground.\",\n                \"Two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this Chamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big enough to take all of the water out of the Sacramento River half of the year, creating an existential threat to the delta.\",\n                \"Something needs to be done, no doubt about it. So by cobbling together the plans that were developed by the Department of Water Resources and others, I put together what I called, a Water Plan for All California.\",\n                \"By the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not create 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water.\",\n                \"What it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that it was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the year. I said: Governor, that doesn't work. Let's look at this in a serious way that can create water for California's future.\",\n                \"This proposal was put together from plans that the State agencies had developed in the past. I commend this to anybody that really wants to look at what California's water future could be. Instead of a battle royal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, and $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and they are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the environmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and just a little bit of mitigation.\",\n                \"Let's do something different. Let's create water that California will need in its future. Let's build a system that will actually deliver more water for California, while protecting the environment, and that is what this plan is all about, a water plan for all California.\",\n                \"There are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; storage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting science run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect the water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and a half--excuse me--a century and a half.\",\n                \"These are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them one at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full $17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first bid; that is not the final cost. Let's say we would spend that $17 billion.\",\n                \"Let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural conservation. Now, every agriculturalist--and I am one--in California will say, Yes, but we are already conserving water. Indeed, we are, and a lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be done again.\",\n                \"There are somewhere, by the estimates of the State, 3 to 4 million acre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that does not include the urban conservation.\",\n                \"Now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's mind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we can do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. That is enough for over 120,000 homes a year per million acre feet.\",\n                \"Secondly, recycling--I often say, and I think this is more or less accurate, that the fifth largest river on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere are the sanitation plants in Southern California.\",\n                \"Whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? Well, consider this: the Colorado River, over here, abutting Arizona and Nevada, water is taken from the Colorado River, 200 miles into the Los Angeles Basin.\",\n                \"Water is taken from northern California, the Sacramento River, in a canal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains, into the Los Angeles Basin. That water is cleaned once. It is used in the Los Angeles Basin, cleaned again, in most cases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern California; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean.\",\n                \"What? You do that in California? Well, we do. Fortunately, Orange County, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the State and probably the Nation in water recycling. We need to do more of it.\",\n                \"For a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple of billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of new water in southern California, water that is already there, water that is not being used.\",\n                \"In northern California, the San Francisco Bay area, for my friends in San Francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest water in America, right out of Yosemite National Park, piping it across the Central Valley into the San Francisco area, clean it--well, you really don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use it once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean.\",\n                \"Recycling is necessary in every part of California. Another million, perhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling.\",\n                \"So conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting close to what California needs in the future.\",\n                \"So where are you going to put the water? Even in the midst of a drought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water.\",\n                \"My colleague from northern California, the Sacramento Valley, Mr. LaMalfa and I have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage reservoir here on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, a reservoir that could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and that water would be available when needed.\",\n                \"It could flow down the Sacramento River, sweetening, pushing back the saltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes in the Sacramento Valley or down in the San Joaquin Valley.\",\n                \"It also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of Shasta, the Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River, and the Folsom Reservoir here on the Sacramento River, giving flexibility to the water managers.\",\n                \"When it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the water out of Sites Reservoir. When it is needed for agriculture or for water quality in the delta, you could use it out of Sites Reservoir, keeping the cold water in Shasta, Oroville, or Folsom that is necessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers.\",\n                \"Storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of Contra Costa, in Los Vaqueros Reservoir, off-stream storage further south down here in Los Banos at the San Luis Reservoir, and the biggest off-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, the great Central Valley of California, arguably, the second or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now seriously overdrafted, as Californians, agriculture, cities, and others thirst for the water in this drought.\",\n                \"These storage reservoirs in northern California are just one part of the storage systems that are needed for the future. The other part actually exists here in southern California, out here along the coast, the West Basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the Santa Ana in Orange County, and as you move east into Riverside and San Bernardino.\",\n                \"These are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that recycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and recycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are contaminated, would be clean and available for the future.\",\n                \"We could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in southern California and have greater storage capacity than the largest reservoir in the State of California, which is Shasta Reservoir, way up here in northern California.\",\n                \"By using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call conjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store it--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. Then when you have your dry periods, as California historically does, you can take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently being taken from these aquifers in California.\",\n                \"We are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the San Joaquin Valley. We are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a year as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water management becomes extremely important in the process.\",\n                \"I want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and remind us, the Sacramento River coming down, the San Joaquin River coming north. From the north, the Sacramento, from the south, the San Joaquin, meeting here in the great delta of California--this delta is seriously at risk, as I said a moment ago.\",\n                \"What to do about this? The Governor's plan, to take water around it, to deliver it to the pumps down here, I think, creates an existential threat. Don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere.\",\n                \"Instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that while the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea level rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out of the delta, even if it is taken around the delta.\",\n                \"The first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key levees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the pumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and to make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water through the delta. It is called the armored delta.\",\n                \"Under the Governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees are going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a much longer period of time. Improve the delta, levees, and that is a job for the Federal Government.\",\n                \"I talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the Federal Government, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by improving the levees on those channels. That is step one.\",\n                \"Step two is what I call science. This area, the richest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, to other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, requires very careful attention and very careful scientific study.\",\n                \"We are talking over here, in a place called Rio Vista, about building a science center, bringing together all the State and Federal agencies so they can work in a collaborative science program. That is a great program called the Rivers Program. There are other science studies that are underway.\",\n                \"You have to let science drive this process. You cannot allow politics to drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; you put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and you put at risk the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere.\",\n                \"Keep in mind that the Congress of the United States, twice in the last 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental protections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre feet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the southern valley, into the southern valley here.\",\n                \"It is a rip-off. It is part of what has taken place in California since the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want water, you simply take it from somebody. In this case, you are taking it from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you are pushing aside the environmental protections. Don't do it. It is not necessary.\",\n                \"There is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and I call it the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp.'' Here it is. This is a map of the delta of California. Sacramento is up here, the confluence of the American River and the Sacramento River. That is the State capital. This is the delta here.\",\n                \"We were talking about it in the larger map. San Francisco Bay is over here, Suisun Bay and the rest. This is the heart of the delta. Stockton is down here. Tracy and the big massive pumps at Tracy, capable of taking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this area.\",\n                \"The tunnels that the Governor wants to build would start here, travel through some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the Nation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s and 1860s, along the Sacramento River, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 miles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. The tunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this area.\",\n                \"$17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large enough to allow for the destruction of the delta? Why would you spend all that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? This is it.\",\n                \"This is the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, an ocean, a channel that begins at San Francisco Bay, comes up the Sacramento River, and then, in a channel that was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, all the way up to the Port of Sacramento here in West Sacramento, on the other side of the State capital.\",\n                \"This is a deep water shipping channel. Ocean ships come into San Francisco Bay and come all the way up here. It is a pretty good economic activity. Agricultural products are shipped out.\",\n                \"I was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. I guess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in California, and those are going to be shipped off to China. I sometimes wonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be making in America, but that is another subject for another day.\",\n                \"So what is an alternative? I call this the little sip solution, ``Little Sip, Big Gulp solution.'' Take the water out of the Sacramento River here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. We know how to do that. Fish screens are already built to do that.\",\n                \"Let it flow down the Deep Water Channel to about here, just north of Rio Vista. Put in a single ship lock and a pump.\",\n                \"Alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here to this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called Old River, take it down to the pumps at Tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second.\",\n                \"You could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 million acre-feet of water to the pumps at Tracy in most years. In this drought year, it wouldn't be possible.\",\n                \"A second alternative would be to take it down the Deep Water Channel, 3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a canal that goes behind Rio Vista here, crosses Sherman Island at the confluence of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, and over to Contra Costa County to the pumps.\",\n                \"This is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a fail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the San Francisco Bay area, because this particular route intersects six aqueducts: the Solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here in Contra Costa; East Bay Municipal Utility aqueduct; the Contra Costa County aqueduct; the Los Vaqueros aqueduct for the Los Vaqueros river; zone seven, down here in the Livermore area, over here in this area; and also the South Bay aqueduct, going all the way down to Silicon Valley.\",\n                \"What has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever arise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the water to this entire Bay area could get access to the Sacramento River water. So if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a result of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a fail-safe solution for the entire Bay region, except Marin County, which has its own water system.\",\n                \"Either of these is a system that would be right-sized. That is a Little Sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is roughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta for southern California, for Los Angeles, and for the San Joaquin Valley.\",\n                \"That is the Little Sip solution: a route through the delta, a pipeline from here to Old River, and then an open channel on the east side of Old River to the pumps, or a canal across Contra Costa and Solano County. Either of them would work. And it would be a fraction of the cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, destroying the agricultural communities here in Portland and Clarksburg and putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size.\",\n                \"This is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. Now, granted, they are only going to build three of the intakes here on the Sacramento River. Okay. It is good to have only three. That gives you 9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the Sacramento River half of the year.\",\n                \"So what does that mean for the delta? It means the delta is going to be salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. And all they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can take all of the water half of the year.\",\n                \"Don't do it. Never build something that could be so destructive of such a precious natural resource as the delta.\",\n                \"So this is the Little Sip.\",\n                \"Where does the rest of the water come? It is called the Big Gulp. Even in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that have sent a surge of water down the San Joaquin and down the Sacramento. The pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the pumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south.\",\n                \"Okay. It worked. Can it work in the future in normal years?\",\n                \"There is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get another 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and that is the Big Gulp. So you combine a small facility with a Big Gulp when the water is available in the delta.\",\n                \"Now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the Governor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. Neither project will work. And, in fact, the California water system today will not work without storage south of the delta.\",\n                \"That is why--to back up to a map of all California--we have to have storage offsite, at Sites Reservoir. There is talk of enlarging Shasta Reservoir, way up here in this area. There is talk of building a new reservoir here on the San Joaquin River at Hanford's flat. There is talk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen--enlarging Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The San Luis Reservoir down here needs to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be expanded.\",\n                \"There is another reservoir site just south of it, Los Banos Grande. That is another large reservoir. And, of course, the aquifers in the entire Central Valley of California, and we have already talked about the aquifers in southern California.\",\n                \"So you have to have storage south of the delta. If you have storage south of the delta, then the Governor's plan or my plan, the Little Sip, Big Gulp plan will work. Storage is absolutely essential in all of these configurations. Fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to work.\",\n                \"Let me just review what we have been talking about here. We have been talking about a water plant for all California.\",\n                \"Conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over here in the Salinas Valley--conservation along this entire area, conservation in southern California, the great metropolitan areas, and in the Bay area. In doing so, the State's own estimate was 5 million. Let's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. Agricultural conservation, urban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is currently unavailable but there.\",\n                \"Recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern California. A $2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, and you already have the storage systems in place, the underground aquifers of southern California. Similarly, recycling in the Bay area.\",\n                \"Sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling program, a $2 billion recycling program in Sacramento to recycle water--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river rather than some of the water, which is a little shady.\",\n                \"So recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you bring on the recycling in the Bay area.\",\n                \"Now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water.\",\n                \"Storage systems, it is estimated that the Sites Reservoir can add in this drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet of water in this drought year. Of course it is not built; it is not available. But on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to 600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of Sites Reservoir; plus, as I described earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, together, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of Sites Reservoir. The other reservoirs can provide additional water also.\",\n                \"So we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere near 5 million acre-feet of new water for California. If we have conservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the current drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual water yield will carry California into the next 30 to 50 years and beyond that, depending on population growth and technologies.\",\n                \"I had not mentioned the use of this water out here. Well, that is the Pacific Ocean. Desalinization and recycling use exactly the same technology. Recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less energy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because the ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is just more expensive. But clearly, desalinization is also in our future.\",\n                \"Down here, in the San Diego area, a new recycling plant is going online this year. They have been talking about one in Santa Barbara that actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. But that one in Santa Barbara is likely to go back online as a result of the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts.\",\n                \"So desalinization is also in California's future.\",\n                \"Those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of new storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; Little Sip, Big Gulp strategy; science-driven process.\",\n                \"Keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you are going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta and other places.\",\n                \"Finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and the laws of California, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of the bill that passed Congress 4 years ago, just blew aside California water rights. So if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want to heighten and enflame a water war in California, push aside the water rights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the drought.\",\n                \"That is a Water Plan for All of California. It is here. It is available. My Web site has it. I recommend it to anybody that is interested in a solution for California's long-term water problems; and also, I recommend to people that we have the Federal Government in the short term align its water policy programs from the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, that those water programs in the short term be aligned with the State of California's bond act so that we can promote, augment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 billion water bond that the California voters passed last November.\",\n                \"My plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, take another look. Take another look at the Little Sip, Big Gulp solution. This actually was something that was first proposed by the Natural Resources Defense Council. We were working with this about 5 years ago. They came up with the Little Sip, Big Gulp name, and with some modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of what the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost.\",\n                \"So, for California, there is a future. It is the Golden State. It is an economy unmatched by any other in the United States. It is an economy particularly--well, actually, the entire State's economy is stressed as a result of the drought. And if we take the kind of steps that I have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the water that California needs in the next drought and in the years to come as the population grows and as the economy grows.\",\n                \"So that is the water plan for all California. There are many other pieces of the puzzle, one of which I am going to take just a second to talk about. And that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for water programs in the State of California--actually, water plans for the United States, not just the State of California--we ought to be mindful of a project called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been in effect for half a century. It takes the royalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of that royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of America--the wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those areas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy up easements so that the land will forever remain available to future generations in a more natural state. That is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this year, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the Congress of the United States to reinstitute and reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\",\n                \"When I was deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior in the mid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along the coast of California, to protect the Everglades of Florida, to set aside some of the land along the sand dunes on the Great Lakes. This is a project for all of America, one that is worthy of being reauthorized and properly funded.\",\n                \"With that, Mr. Speaker, perhaps enough about California's drought. No, I will take that back.\",\n                \"Mr. Speaker, we have got a problem in California, short term and long term, and it deserves the attention of the Congress of the United States because California is the seventh largest economy in the world and critically important to the future of this Nation.\",\n                \"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\"\n            ],\n            \"capitolwords_url\": \"http://capitolwords.org/date/2015/06/23/H4584-2_california-drought/\",\n            \"speaker_party\": \"D\",\n            \"date\": \"2015-06-23\",\n            \"bills\": null,\n            \"bioguide_id\": \"G000559\",\n            \"pages\": \"H4584-H4588\",\n            \"speaker_last\": \"Garamendi\",\n            \"speaker_raw\": \"mr. garamendi\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker_state\": null,\n            \"speaker_first\": null,\n            \"congress\": 114,\n            \"title\": \"REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON PUBLIC BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS\",\n            \"origin_url\": \"http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-01-02/html/CREC-2015-01-02-pt1-PgH10333.htm\",\n            \"number\": 156,\n            \"order\": 0,\n            \"volume\": 160,\n            \"chamber\": \"House\",\n            \"session\": 1,\n            \"id\": \"CREC-2015-01-02-pt1-PgH10333.chunk0\",\n            \"speaking\": [\n                \" Under clause 2 of rule XIII, reports of committees were delivered to the Clerk for printing and reference to the proper calendar, as follows:[Pursuant to clause 1(d), rule XI, the following reports were filed on December 18, 2014] Mr. LUCAS: Committee on Agriculture.

This is crucial as we begin to restore the trust of the American people.\",\n                \"This week, we will take the next step and start to work on a joint balanced budget resolution with our colleagues in the House that will expand America's economy and increase opportunities for hard-working families. A balanced budget approved by Congress will help make the government live within its means and set spending limits for our Nation. A balanced budget will also boost the Nation's economic output by more than $500 billion over the next 10 years. That is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\",\n                \"Why the urgency? Hard-working families are fed up with the President's spend-now-pay-later policy and are closely following our efforts to produce a balanced budget. Senate Democrats could only muster two budgets in 8 years, and we will soon have one after only 4 months. It is time to show taxpayers that Congress is committed to a balanced budget to make our government more effective and accountable, but we are running out of time.\",\n                \"Recent media reports note that the lawmakers in 27 States have passed applications for a constitutional convention to approve a balanced budget amendment. I have to add that there are new applications to do that same amendment in nine other States, and they are close behind.\",\n                \"Now, if just seven of those nine States approve moving forward on the balanced budget issue, it would bring the number of applications to 34 States. This would mean the two-thirds requirement under Article V of the Constitution would force Congress to take action. It is no wonder hard-working taxpayers across the country are feeling anxious.\",\n                \"Federal revenues have hit record highs. Yet we are on track to overspend by nearly $1 trillion a year. I think we are at the $560 billion level of overspending this year.\",\n                \"How much does Congress get to make decisions on? Congress spends about $4 trillion a year, but only gets to make decisions on $1\\\\1/10\\\\ trillion. Now, if we overspend by over $500 billion, we are spending half more than what we take in. No family can exist very long by spending half more than they take in year after year after year.\",\n                \"We looked at the President's budget and the President increases taxes by $2\\\\1/10\\\\ trillion and still gets a wider and wider and wider gap of overspending as time goes by to that trillion-dollar mark out there in 10 years.\",\n                \"Just this week, headlines around the country reported: ``Budget Deficit in U.S. Widens as Spending Exceeds Record Revenue.''\",\n                \"On Monday, the Treasury Department reported that spending by the Federal Government exceeded its revenue by more than $439 billion from October through March, which is $26 billion more compared to the same period last year. In fact, CBO is forecasting that for March our Nation spent more than $44 billion, up 19 percent from last year. We are getting more money, and we are spending more money.\",\n                \"American taxpayers understand we overspend. The more we overspend, the more debt we owe, and the more debt our children and grandchildren will owe. In fact, we have done this so consistently that it is not just our grandchildren and our children who are faced with the crisis, it is us as well--everybody in America.\",\n                \"I mentioned that we get to make decisions on $1\\\\1/10\\\\ trillion dollars a year, which is $1,100 billion. If anybody knows how big $1 billion is, they know how big $1,100 billion is. But that is all we get to make decisions on.\",\n                \"The amount of interest we paid last year was $235 billion. Interest doesn't buy you a thing, but we spent $235 billion on interest. Now, that is pretty close to 1 percent for the fee for that borrowing. So if $235 billion is 1 percent interest, what would the normal 5 percent cost? Every single dime we get to make a decision on. That means no defense, no education, no HELP. Everything will be by the wayside just so we can pay the interest on our debt. That is why we have to be concerned about the overspending that is happening.\",\n                \"American taxpayers understand that the more we overspend, the more debt we owe and the more debt our children and grandchildren owe. If that tax rate goes up, we will soon be responsible for paying off that debt at the expense of everything else America expects. This is why Republicans in Congress are focused on passing a balanced budget that will ensure that Washington will once again live within its means, just like hard-working families do every day.\",\n                \"Now, we don't get that balance for 10 years, but it moves toward that goal every year. Ten years is too long. For next year's budget, we are going to have to figure out better things to do to get it back into a framework where our interest will not exceed our expenditures. That is the interest exceeding the expenditures, not the revenue, and again we had a record revenue. That is why we are focused on passing a balanced budget, just like hard-working families do every day.\",\n                \"What does the Senate-passed budget do? Well, here is what it does: It balances the budget in 10 years with no tax hikes. It protects our most vulnerable citizens. It strengthens the national defense. It improves job growth and opportunity for hard-working families. It slows the rate of spending growth.\",\n                \"Now, it doesn't recede the spending growth, it slows the spending growth. That is the best we have ever been able to do in Washington. When we talk about a cut in Washington, what we are talking about is giving them less than what they asked for, not less than what they have.\",\n                \"It preserves Social Security by reducing spending in other areas to fully offset Social Security's rising deficit and encourages our Nation's leaders to begin a bipartisan, bicameral discussion on how to protect Social Security and avoid the across-the-board Social Security benefit cuts that will occur later under the law unless we take action, but that is something that has to be done jointly. There would be too much blame otherwise, and as far as the budget, the reason we have to preserve Social Security by reducing spending in other areas to offset Social Security is because we are not allowed to do anything with Social Security in the budget.\",\n                \"This budget will also protect our seniors by safeguarding Medicare from insolvency and extending the life of the Medicare trust fund by 5 years. It ensures Medicare savings in the President's health care law and makes sure those savings are dedicated to Medicare. If it comes from Medicare, it ought to go back to Medicare instead of seeing it go to more overspending on new programs that are outside of Medicare.\",\n                \"Our balanced budget continues funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and creates a new program based on CHIP to serve low-income, working-age, able-bodied adults and children who are eligible for Medicaid.\",\n                \"It increases State flexibility in designing benefits and administering Medicaid Programs to encourage efficiency and reduce wasteful spending, and it provides stable and predictable funding so long-term services and support are sustainable both for the Federal Government and the States.\",\n                \"As the Senate and House begin budget negotiations next week, it is worth noting that the strong economic growth a balanced budget can provide will serve as the foundation for helping all Americans grow and prosper.\",\n                \"One of the goals of a Republican balanced budget is to make our government more efficient, more effective, and more accountable. If Congress does its job, we can have some flexibility and eliminate what is not working, starting with the worst first, and then we can eliminate and streamline what is left.\",\n                \"The reason I emphasized ``the worst first'' is because one of the things we talk about constantly is the need to prevent the sequester. In some cases, it is absolutely essential to prevent a sequester, but the sequester should have been done in the efficient way of eliminating the worst first. Instead, there was a memo that went out that said: Make it hurt. That should never happen in America. That is why we saw some of the decisions that came down that seemed pretty ridiculous.\",\n                \"One of the decisions that affected Wyoming was--I hope everybody will come and see the Grand Tetons--marvelous mountains that look like part of the Alps were transplanted over there and made a little bit taller. A lot of people like to stop and take pictures there regardless of the season--whether it is snow covered or the aspens are golden in the foreground or whether everything is lush and green, and, of course, you see wildlife all through that valley. Naturally, people like to stop and take pictures.\",\n                \"Well, a bunch of signs were printed up that said you cannot use the turnouts. A bunch of barricades were bought so you could not pull onto the turnout, and the sign said it would be illegal to park along the highway.\",\n                \"Where did the money come from for the barricades? Where did the money come for the signs that said we could not use the parking lots to take pictures? Well, I called to find out whose brilliant idea that was and why parking lots would be closed, and I was told that there would not be any garbage pickup. I suggested they just remove the garbage cans.\",\n                \"When people in Wyoming and across the Nation visit a national park, they can haul their garbage another 20 miles before they throw it out. That way the beautiful vista could still be photographed instead of people still parking along the highways to take those pictures and then getting ticketed. That is just one small example of cutting the most important first instead of the worst first. I am sure there are examples in every State.\",\n                \"It didn't just happen with facilities like that. The people at Head Start came to see me and said they got a 7.5-percent cut in the sequester. It was supposed to be 2.3 percent.\",\n                \"How did it get to 7.5 percent? After checking into it, it appears the Washington bureaucracy decided to keep more than their share of the money instead giving it to the kids across America who were supposed to have it. It did get restored, but the discouraging part was that when I asked the people who talked to me before how things were going, they said: Well, we got the extra money, but in order to meet the employer requirements in Wyoming for ObamaCare, we had to spend all of that money, so none of the kids happened to go back to Head Start. That was very disappointing. That is not the way to run a government and it is not the way to run a business. It should never have happened.\",\n                \"We need a budget that can eliminate waste and streamline what is left and start with the worst first.\",\n                \"Of course, another of my suggestions is that we have a biannual budget. Mr. President, $1,100 billion is too much money to look at in 1 year. Twelve bills to allocate that money to the different agencies are too many bills for us to handle in 1 year, particularly if they are going to get scrutiny.\",\n                \"I suggested we write the number of bills that we do and separate them into two packages of six and that we do the six tough ones right after the election, because we have a little more appetite for doing them then, and the six easy ones just before an election. Then we would be able to get all 12 of them and be able to scrutinize all 12 of them.\",\n                \"Why is that important? Well, in going through this budget process--and like I said, I only had about 8 weeks to start to put the budget together--one of the things I discovered was that we have a whole bunch of programs that are out of authorization. The ability to spend for them has expired, but that doesn't stop us from spending on them. It should at least constrain us a little bit.\",\n                \"Some of those programs go back to 1983. They expired in 1983, 1987, and on up to the present day. How many of them? Two hundred and sixty programs. There were 260 programs that we haven't looked at to see if we ought to continue to spend money on them or if we ought to revise how we have been spending the money. If they have expired--most of them had been in existence for 6 years before they expired, and in those 6 years, we should have been able to find if there were any flaws or changes. Hopefully, there was somebody who was looking out for it and found some efficiencies that helped with the spending.\",\n                \"So there were 260 programs. Do we know how much that amounts to that we are still spending and there is no authority to spend? It is $293 billion a year. That is a year. Usually, when we talk about the budget we are talking about over 10 years. So that would only be $29 billion a year if it were over 10 years, but it is not. It is $293 billion a year of expired authorizations, expired permissions to spend money. We have to get that corrected as well.\",\n                \"One of the ways we can do that is through a biennial budget, so that we are looking at half of them in a year instead of everything the government does every year. The dollars have gotten so big that we can't get through them efficiently, effectively, and scrutinizing them as good accounting in a year.\",\n                \"There is one exception on that, which is that we look at defense every year. Defense is the most important constitutional requirement given to this body. So we would continue to do that each year. Incidentally, defense is the one authorization that is not out of authorization, and that is because we do it every year. I don't know how many decades we have done the authorization--the permission for spending--for defense.\",\n                \"Another troubling situation I discovered through this process was that there are some items that are not authorized that were in defense that we are spending money on anyway. I get comments from the people on the committee that looks over defense saying: How can they spend that money when we just did an authorization that said no, that is not one of the authorized items? So there are some problems we need to definitely work on with budgets. That is what we have done while putting this budget together, in trying to eliminate some of the inconsistencies we have, but we have not touched that $293 billion in unauthorized spending.\",\n                \"So when people say we need more money for the nondefense items, I want them to take a look at that $293 billion and see if they can't find $29 billion, $90 billion, whatever, out of $293 billion that they think might be more effectively spent in a different way.\",\n                \"I know when I came to Congress there were 119 preschool children's programs. Everybody has ideas for preschool programs, and they are good ideas. We know that if we teach kids better before they go to school, they do better in school, there are fewer dropouts, there is less crime, and the whole world is better.\",\n                \"There were 119 programs. Senator Kennedy and I worked on that, and we got it down to 69 programs. The ones we got rid of are the ones that were under our jurisdiction. So that left a whole bunch more. In the meantime, I have been able to work that down to 35 programs. And in the child care grant program last year, I got an amendment passed--it was one of 14 amendments that we considered--which required that those 35 go down to just 5 and that all 5 be put under 1 department. I am hoping that is what the administration is doing. That would save enough money to fund the truly preschool education programs really well, and that is what we need to do. There is a lot of money right there.\",\n                \"So if Congress does its job, we can have some flexibility and eliminate what isn't working, starting with the worst first, and then we can eliminate waste and streamline what is left. But to do this, first, Congress must do what it has not done in the past 8 years. It has to scrutinize every dollar for which they have a responsibility. If government programs are not delivering results, they should be improved, and if they are not needed, they should be eliminated. It is time to prioritize and demand results from our government programs. When these programs are reauthorized, I am hoping there is a matrix in there that says this is what we plan to do and this is how we will know if we got it done. Then we will have an easy evaluation of whether they are getting their job done. That is mostly what happens in the private sector, and it is an efficient way of doing it in the public sector as well.\",\n                \"I have made enough speeches about efficiency in government that I had someone come up to me and say: I hate to say this, but the job I am doing isn't worth having anybody do. He said: I am reluctant to mention it because if they eliminate that job, I am probably fired. Well, I took his suggestion, and I spoke to the right people and that job got eliminated, and he got promoted. That is what has to happen.

Maybe number one now is ``comptroller,'' but it didn't used to be.\",\n                \"To the Comptroller General Dodaro, here is the letter that 22 of us sent yesterday: ``As you know, on November 20, 2014, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, issued a series of memoranda affecting federal immigration law. Included in the new DHS policy directives was an order to extend and expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as well as an order to establish a new program that provides work authorization permits to an estimated five million undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. This new program was termed, `Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents,' or DAPA.\",\n                \"``U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is the federal agency that adjudicates applications for immigration benefits. This agency's website claims a workforce of 19,000 people operating throughout 223 offices worldwide with an annual operating budget of $4 billion. This agency is very unique from many other agencies. According to its own FY16 USCIS Budget Request, 96.8% of the agency's annual operating budget comes from fees collected from applicants for most types of immigration benefits, from petitions to sponsor relatives or employees, to replacement green cards, to naturalization applications. These fee-based revenues appear to be considered `permanently appropriated' mandatory funds compared to annual discretionary appropriations which apply to federal agencies. As a result, this permanently appropriated mandatory spending allotment for USCIS falls outside the annual appropriations process.\",\n                \"``While Congress determines the categories of aliens that are to be admitted into the United States, it does not always set the fees USCIS charges or constructively control how USCIS allocates its resources. This fee-generated portion of its annual budget, translating to $3.874 billion in FY16, appears to be completely fungible. That is, this money, raised for one purpose can perhaps be used for other purposes. This arrangement creates the potential for USCIS to, in effect, create slush funds and skim off congressionally authorized fees imposed on legal immigrants and their sponsors in order to fund programs that may not be specifically authorized by Congress. Mr. Joseph Moore, the Chief Financial Officer of USCIS, testified in a Senate hearing on March 3, 2015, that the agency determines the fees it charges based on a practice known as activity-based costing. Thus, transaction fees are proportional to the amount of time and resources to fulfill that transaction. However, records indicate that USCIS has a carry-over balance from excess revenues at the end of FY14 of approximately $1.27 billion. Mr. Moore claimed that he seeks to maintain a rolling reserve balance of about $600 million to cover unexpected costs and surge activity. He further stated that funds from this account helped USCIS handle early spending in response to the executive actions. Eventually, new fees paid by illegal immigrant applicants are intended to replenish that account, plus cover all the new costs. What is not clear is why or how this agency has built up reserves of more than twice the amount it says it aims to keep for contingency requirements. This draws scrutiny as to how long this practice has occurred, for what reasons, what can or cannot be done with that money and, ultimately, how Congress can effectively conduct oversight.\",\n                \"``Experts refer to this arrangement where an agency can skim off, or `tax,' certain types of applications in order to fund others as `cross-subsidization.' Currently, fees from legal immigrants and their sponsors subsidize refugee and asylum applications, military naturalizations, the anti-fraud division, and other activities--with `other activities' being very broadly defined.''\",\n                \"So we go on and ask for the Comptroller General to audit the Department of Homeland Security because we haven't gotten truthful answers, and we haven't gotten complete answers.\",\n                \"It appears we have a shadow government in existence that can go across the river and lease or purchase, spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars--we don't know--without any accountability to anybody.\",\n                \"It moves toward being like a Kafka novel of just a completely unaccountable mammoth government that no individual can ever take on.

We are asking the GAO to audit USCIS and find out critically needed answers.

It has got to stop, and we have to know exactly what they are doing so that we can get them back with acting within the constitutional requisites.\",\n                \"The Department of Homeland Security has been so obsessed, as directed by the President, with having open borders and bringing in illegal immigrants.

But unfortunately, for the last 36 years, Iran's attacks against the United States have been anything but mock, and the targets have been all too real.\",\n                \"Iran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran; murdered hundreds of American soldiers, marines in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American servicemen and -women in Iraq and Afghanistan.\",\n                \"Beyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires; it helped al Qaeda bomb U.S. Embassies in Africa; it even attempted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador right here in Washington, D.C.\",\n                \"In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals--Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and Sana'a. And if Iran's aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.\",\n                \"So at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.\",\n                \"We must all stand together to stop Iran's march of conquest, subjugation, and terror.\",\n                \"Now, 2 years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran--some change, some moderation. Rouhani's government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists, and executes even more prisoners than before.\",\n                \"Last year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyah. Imad Mughniyah is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I would like to see someone ask him a question about that.\",\n                \"Iran's regime is as radical as ever, its cries of ``Death to America,'' that same America that it calls the great Satan, as loud as ever. Now this shouldn't be surprising because the ideology of Iran's revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that is why this regime will always be an enemy of America.\",\n                \"And don't be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn't turn Iran into a friend of America. Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic; the other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire, first on the region, and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.\",\n                \"In this deadly game of thrones, there is no place for America or for Israel; no peace for Christians, Jews, or Muslims who don't share the Islamist medieval creed; no rights for women; no freedom for anyone.\",\n                \"So when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy. The difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons, and YouTube; whereas, Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs.\",\n                \"We must always remember--I will say it one more time--the greatest danger facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle but lose the war. We can't let that happen. But that, my friends, is exactly what could happen if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.\",\n                \"Let me explain why.\",\n                \"While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don't need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.\",\n                \"Absent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran. The first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. ``Breakout time'' is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.\",\n                \"According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected but not destroyed. Because Iran's nuclear program would be left largely in tact, Iran's breakout time would be very short--about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel's. And if Iran's work on advanced centrifuges--faster and faster centrifuges--is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter--a lot shorter.\",\n                \"True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran's nuclear program, and Iran's adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here is the problem, you see: inspectors document violations; they don't stop them.\",\n                \"Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors; and, within a few years, it got the bomb.\",\n                \"Now, we are warned that within 5 years, North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs. Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It has done that on at least three separate occasions, 2005, 2006, and 2010.\",\n                \"Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks and shut off the cameras. Now, I know this is not going to come as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.\",\n                \"The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught--caught twice, not once--twice operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn't even know existed. Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we--the U.S. and Israel--don't know about.\",\n                \"As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said in 2013: ``If there is no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time in 20 years that it doesn't have one.'' Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted, and that is why the first major concession is a source of grave concern.\",\n                \"It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.\",\n                \"But the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal because virtually all the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.\",\n                \"Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it is the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It is the blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran's nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could produce many, many nuclear bombs.\",\n                \"Iran's Supreme Leader says that openly. He says that Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges--not 6,000 or even the 19,000 that Iran has today, but ten times that amount--190,000 centrifuges enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks once it makes that decision.\",\n                \"My longtime friend John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires. Now, I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons--and this with full international legitimacy.\",\n                \"By the way, if Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile program is not part of the deal--and, so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table--well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reaching corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.\",\n                \"You see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program; and, two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That is why this deal is so bad. It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.\",\n                \"Why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse.\",\n                \"Well, I disagree. I don't believe that Iran's radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power for 36 years, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would only whet Iran's appetite for more.\",\n                \"Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger? If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it is under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted?\",\n                \"Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism? Why should Iran's radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both worlds: aggression abroad and prosperity at home?\",\n                \"This is a question that everyone asks in our region. Israel's neighbors--Iran's neighbors--know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it has been given a clear path to the bomb. Many of these neighbors say that they will respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own.\",\n                \"This deal won't change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that is supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.\",\n                \"This deal won't be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control, and the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.\",\n                \"If anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we will face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs, and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have come here today to tell you we don't have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don't have to gamble with our future and with our children's future. We can insist that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.\",\n                \"Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things: first, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East; second, stop supporting terrorism around the world; and, third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.\",\n                \"If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least, they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.\",\n                \"If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn't change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted. If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.\",\n                \"My friends, what about the argument that there is no alternative to this deal, that Iran's nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is, essentially, what the proposed deal seeks to do?\",\n                \"Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn't get you very much. A race car driver without a car can't drive; a pilot without a plane can't fly; without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium, or heavy water facilities, Iran can't make nuclear weapons.\",\n                \"Iran's nuclear program can be rolled back well beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.\",\n                \"Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table--and this often happens in a Persian bazaar--call their bluff. They will be back because they need the deal a lot more than you do. And by maintaining the pressure on Iran, and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.\",\n                \"My friends, for over a year, we have been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal, it is a very bad deal. We are better off without it.\",\n                \"Now we are being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That is just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal, a better deal that doesn't leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure in such a short breakout time, a better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in place until Iran's aggression ends, a better deal that won't give Iran an easy path to the bomb, a better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like but with which we could live, literally. And no country, no country has a greater stake, no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths.\",\n                \"One path leads to a bad deal that will, at best, curtail Iran's nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war.\",\n                \"The second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East, and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity.\",\n                \"You don't have to read Robert Frost to know you have to live life, to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East, and the peace of the world, the peace that we all desire.\",\n                \"My friends, standing up to Iran is not easy; standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is.

And I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past, not to sacrifice the future for the present, not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace. But I can guarantee you this: the days when the Jewish people remain passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over.

The answer is: within this decade, we will.\",\n                \"As the current phase of our relationship draws to a close, our appreciation for the depth of America's contribution to our people cannot be measured in words alone, but it can be seen quite literally in the number of Afghans whose futures have been changed thanks to America and its allies.\",\n                \"On September 10, 2001--this will no longer shock you--there were no girls enrolled in school in Afghanistan. It was illegal to educate girls. Today, more than 3 million girls in primary schools across the country are learning to openly and actively participate in the future of a democratic Afghanistan.\",\n                \"Their parents thank you.\",\n                \"In 2002, when the allies built their first clinics, the average lifespan of the ordinary Afghan was 44 years. Today, it is over 60.\",\n                \"Their children thank you.\",\n                \"Today, the rate of maternal mortality in our poor country remains unacceptably high, but thanks to the immense effort you have made to build clinics and to train nurses, an Afghan woman is no longer more likely to die because she gives birth to a child than if she had somehow fought on the front line of combat.\",\n                \"Their husbands and their children thank you.\",\n                \"Our partnership with America and its allies has brought our country hope where we had none. We would, once again, like to thank you for that wonderful gift from your people to ours, the gift of hope; but, in Afghanistan, there is a saying that no gift can remain unreciprocated.\",\n                \"Today, I would like to return that gift of reborn hope by offering the American people a partnership with a nation that is committed to the cause of freedom and that will join the fight against the growing threat of terrorism.\",\n                \"I will use my remarks today to tell America the history of how a future Afghanistan came to be. It is a story about how a poor country that relied on foreign help became a self-reliant nation where free trade and the rule of law let Afghan businesses create jobs and prosperity for its people. It is also a story about how a country that had been ravaged by conflict became a platform for peace and regional stability and prosperity.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, the story about Afghanistan's path to self-reliance has already started. It began with last year's election and the formation of our national unity government. Afghanistan's external image is of a traditional country that has been frozen in time; but my partner and the CEO of Afghanistan, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, and I ran intense and passionate campaigns on the most modern of issues, such as the need to end corruption, taking the actions that will build transparency into government, and guaranteeing support for the impartial rule of law. Campaigns became forums for public debate.\",\n                \"In the final election, not only did more than 7 million Afghans turn out to the polls, but more than 38 percent of the votes were cast by women, many of whom had never previously had the chance to speak politically with their own voices.\",\n                \"There is no denying that the election was hard fought, but in the end, we chose the politics of unity over the politics of division. The national unity government brings together all parts of the country to make the government the arena where disputes are raised and resolved.\",\n                \"Dr. Abdullah and myself may not initially agree on every issue, but we both believe deeply that spirited debate will produce better outcomes than will confrontational stalemate. We not only work together, we like working well together.\",\n                \"The Afghanistan country, to world perception, is well suited to democracy. Like Americans, Afghans are individualists. None of us defers to anyone else. We have neither had caste nor class, so persuading each other is an art form.\",\n                \"Our key characteristics are our openness and hospitality. We believe in equality. Even in the most traditional parts of the country, our leadership must earn rather than inherit their positions. There is a strong public conscience. People are expected to act for the common good. We love debate.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to introduce you to Afghanistan. We are an old country with a proud heritage and a history of trade with our neighbors. We have had bills of exchange for at least 2,000 years, and our women could write 2,500 years ago. For at least three millennia, we have been a hub for the caravans and trade networks that spread across Asia, bringing Chinese silks and Indian textiles to ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy.\",\n                \"The 19th century disrupted this world, as it did in so many other places. Afghanistan became an isolated buffer caught between two expanding empires. The emergence of the Soviet Union further isolated our country, culminating in the 1979 invasion and the subsequent war of resistance.\",\n                \"Today, however, the isolation is over. First, awareness is growing that Afghanistan is, quite literally, the heart of Asia. Asia cannot become a continental economy without us. Asia, in the next 25 years, will have its 1869 moment--the year that the East and West Coasts of the United States were joined through the transcontinental railway--but this completion of a new, interconnected Asia cannot happen without us. We are in the midst of 3\\\\1/2\\\\ billion people, and we should be able to export something and not just import.\",\n                \"Our fragmented geography can once again become the opportunity for integrating central, west, east, and south Asia into a network that supports stability and prosperity over a vast swath of the world's surface. Diplomatic efforts to advance integration can free up cross-border trade and support multicountry investments in energy, transport, and water; and this, again, is beginning. The first major project between central Asia and south Asia, called CASA 1000, for transmitting energy from Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan is already underway.\",\n                \"I truly believe that diplomatic efforts backed by the leaders of our countries will build the peace and prosperity for south and central Asia in the same way that the common market has done so for Europe and ASEAN has done for our neighboring region to the east. We envisage an Afghanistan that in 20 years has become a hub of trade and gas pipelines, power transmission lines, railways, modern telecom, and banking services; but American support for all of these is essential, and we thank you for that commitment.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, if one story of our future history is bright, there is another, darker cloud that is making its way towards our country. Afghanistan's security transition took place against the backdrop of the unexpected rise of religious extremism in the Middle East. The promise of the Arab Spring gave way to the emergence of Daesh terror and collapse of states, but the changed ecology of terror could have not formed without some states tolerating, financing, providing sanctuary, and using violent, nonstate actors as instruments of shortsighted policies.\",\n                \"It is critical that the world understand the terrible threat that the Daesh and its allied forces pose to the states of western and central Asia. Terrorist movements, whose goal is to destabilize every state in the region, are looking for new bases of operation. We are the front line, but terrorists neither recognize boundaries nor require passports to spread their message of hate and discord. From the west, the Daesh is already sending advance guards to southern and western Afghanistan to test our vulnerabilities. To the south, Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations, in which more than 40,000 people have already died, are pushing the Taliban from South Waziristan toward Afghanistan's border region.\",\n                \"Criminalization of the economy is an indispensable part of this new ecology of terror. Control over the narcotics trade is providing the financing for these groups to find weapons and recruits, blurring the lines between criminal economics and criminal politics.\",\n                \"Each of these groups poses a clear and present danger to our neighbors, to the Arab-Islamic world, and to the world at large. Afghanistan is carrying forward everyone's fight by containing this threat. But extremism is becoming a system, one that, like a dangerous virus, is constantly mutating, becoming more lethal, very media savvy, well financed, and thriving on state weakness and an overall lack of regional coordination.\",\n                \"To date, Afghanistan's people have rejected the allure of violent movements. We are willing to speak truth to terror.\",\n                \"Military fighting may stem the advance of extremism, but it will not put an end to the anger and hatred being promulgated across Muslim majority countries by these groups. That hatred must be challenged and overcome from within the religion of Islam.\",\n                \"The heart of the issue remains who is entitled to speak for Islam. Leaders, intellectuals, and those many millions of Muslims who believe that Islam is a religion of tolerance and virtue must find their voice. Silence is not acceptable.\",\n                \"But silence is not what the world will hear from us. Afghanistan is joining a new consensus that is emerging in the Muslim world, a consensus that rejects intolerance, extremism, and war. Scholars such as Fredrick Starr have documented beautifully central Asia's long tradition of rationalism and scientific inquiry. During Islam's Golden Age, Muslim scholars synthesized and recorded all known knowledge of the medieval world, giving the world advances in algebra, astronomy, water resource management, printing, and positive science. This is the Islamic civilization that needs to reinvent itself.\",\n                \"The Islamic world must understand its own gloriously tolerant and inquisitive past. It must reengage with the world openly and without paranoia of encirclement.\",\n                \"We, the unity government of Afghanistan, know that Islam is a religion of peace. We are responding to extremist threats by building partnerships at the global, regional, Islamic, and national levels of governance. \",\n                \"Globally, Afghanistan abides by international conventions and the rule of law. We are staunch supporters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is firmly embedded in our Constitution, obliging the state to achieve these rights for our citizens. We are committed to supporting our independent human rights commission, and I am pleased that Dr. Sima Samar, a tireless champion of human rights, is a member of this delegation and is today sitting in the audience of this great Chamber. And our government will join the free trade system and harmonized investment rules that build prosperity and promote peace.\",\n                \"Regionally, we are engaging our neighbors across Asia to build trust and trade. Afghanistan will become a platform for cooperation in a vast region that extends from India to Azerbaijan and beyond. We have already made significant headway in making the vision of the Lapis Lazuli Corridor that will link us to Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Europe into a reality. Thank you, Members of Congress, for wearing Lapis Lazuli.\",\n                \"The Arab Islamic world, from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Iran, is keenly aware of the new threats, and we hope they will soon agree on a regional framework for cooperation. The recent declaration of a Council of Ulema across the Muslim world may well be a historic turning point in building that alliance.\",\n                \"Condemnation of terror by this largest gathering of Muslim Ulema is an unprecedented step in acknowledgment of the shortcomings of Muslim majority country governments.\",\n                \"Properly supported, Afghanistan is uniquely positioned to block the spread of extremism. We have none of the historical inferiority complexes that fuel the resentment against Western domination. After all, we defeated most of the empires.\",\n                \"With the bitter exception of the aberrant Taliban regime, Afghan Islam has traditionally been inclusive and reflective, not violent and angry. And after 36 years of conflict, our people are well-vaccinated against the seduction of ideologically based conflicts.\",\n                \"Our people, our children, desperately want to be normal. Ordinary is what has escaped us--and we would really like to be leading ordinary lives: to go to school and come back, to shop without being blown up, to play volleyball without being attacked. So many children I have held in my arms who have been mutilated. That must not be permitted and cannot be permitted and will not be permitted.\",\n                \"For Afghanistan to oppose the violence of extremists, we must turn our sights to the struggle to end the conditions that give rise to extremism in the first place. Our effort begins with the frank recognition of our problems and the challenges that we must tackle with determination and commitment.\",\n                \"Nearly 40 years of conflict have produced a country where corruption permeates our government. Until we root out this cancer, our government will never generate the trust to win the hearts of our people or the trust of your taxpayers. We will eliminate corruption.\",\n                \"On our second day in office, we tackled the notorious case of Kabul Bank, which for years had lay in abeyance. I am pleased to report to you that all the court systems of Afghanistan, including the supreme court, has now made a decision against these thieves and has allowed us to collect from them. And we will collect and get the public purse refilled.\",\n                \"Ladies and gentlemen, ending corruption and impunity are the precursors of self-reliance, but the true test will be whether we can restore the fiscal basis of public expenditure. We must create an environment where private investment, sustainable natural resources, and critical market-linking infrastructure development provide our youth with jobs, help us balance the budget, and launch the virtuous cycle that will let freed markets build our nation's wealth.\",\n                \"Here, I am pleased to report that we are reversing decades of mismanagement. We have just reached an agreement with IMF. But, most significantly, we are determined to create the wealth that will not make us dependent.\",\n                \"During this decade, we can assure you that we will be able to pay both for our security and delivery of our services.\",\n                \"If economic growth is the first foundation block of self-reliance, the second foundation is with the education of Afghanistan's women.\",\n                \"No country in the modern world can be self-reliant with half of its population locked away, uneducated and unable to contribute its energy, creativity, and drive to national development.\",\n                \"We have a tradition of respecting women. And let us not forget the largest trader in Arabia was the wife of the Prophet. And the greater transmitter of knowledge--the authentic sayings of the Prophet--was his second wife.\",\n                \"Aberrant customs do not replace the fundamental sense of justice between men and women that societies that seek fairness are built upon.\",\n                \"Afghan culture traditionally had space for women as leaders, managers, and traders. The gender apartheid imposed by the Taliban came from people who had grown up outside of families, in refugee camps and religious boarding schools.\",\n                \"Our plan for restoring women's place in society is built of three pillars that rest on a foundation of respect for the human, religious, and constitutional rights of all of our citizens.\",\n                \"First--and I want to spend a little time on this theme--educating women is not solely a matter of rights, important though they are. It is a matter of national necessity.\",\n                \"I have said in the past that educating one Afghan young girl will change the next five generations of a family. I would not be standing before you today as an educated man had my grandmother--in exile in India who had learned to read under the British--not taken it upon herself to make sure that I would match my youthful passion for hunting and riding horses with mastering the classics in Dari and Pashto and striving to excel in foreign languages.\",\n                \"Thank you, Grandmother.\",\n                \"Afghanistan's self-reliance demands men and women who can run a modern economy. Basic health and education must reach all Afghan girls. That is a promise. But beyond providing all Afghan girls with these basic rights, we will increase to parity the number of women graduating from high schools and colleges.\",\n                \"Even as I address you today, in Kabul designs are already being finished for an all-women's university that will provide safe, top-quality education for the next generation of Afghan women leaders.\",\n                \"Let me tell you the story of Khatera Afghan, a young woman from Kandahar. Her schooling began when she braved threats of disfigurement by people swearing that they would throw acid in her face before they would let a girl attend a school. She would not be dissuaded. Her uncle threatened to disown her when she applied to university. But she stared him down.\",\n                \"Khatera went to the American University of Afghanistan, where she not only topped her class but, aided by a Fulbright scholarship, went on to get a master's degree from the Ohio State University.\",\n                \"Today, Khatera's formerly angry uncle is so proud of her that he tells his grandchildren, both little boys and little girls, that they must be as brave as their Aunt Khatera.\",\n                \"Khatera, like thousands of Afghan women, thanks America for those opportunities--for the primary school teachers, for the university in Kabul, for the scholarship to Ohio--that changed her life and her children's future. And she is dedicated to create opportunities for millions of other Afghans.\",\n                \"The second pillar is that women must have the same access to economic opportunities as men. Women's full empowerment will come about, not through global conventions or government programs, but when they have jobs and own businesses.\",\n                \"The United States has been a steadfast supporter of the nationwide National Solidarity Program which, for 10 years, has given not thousands but millions of poor village women their first chance to control their own resources.\",\n                \"Our third and final foundational belief is that a mental and cultural revolution must take place over the treatment of women in and by our society. There is no point talking about how much we respect women's honor if we let rape go unpunished or allow harassment in our streets. \",\n                \"We have signed the global conventions to end violence and discrimination against women; we will implement them vigorously, but work is still needed to convince our people that the protection of women's rights is part and parcel of their own quest for social justice.\",\n                \"I, personally, as the leader of Afghanistan, am committed to working with the ulema, activists, and thought leaders of our country to bring about this mental change. Both the CEO, Dr. Abdullah, and I will insist that the officials of our government set the national standard for workplace fairness.\",\n                \"Thanks to your help and support, the opportunities for women are indeed changing. I am sure that many of you have seen those stunning Skateistan videos of fathers proudly taking their shiny-eyed daughters to show off their newfound skills in the ancient art of skateboarding. They are but the tip of the changes that are underway and which must be protected and advanced.\",\n                \"I am meeting, frequently, women who are entertaining the idea--seriously--the idea of becoming the first woman President of Afghanistan, and we will support them.\",\n                \"I am pleased to state that we have fulfilled our promise to name four women to the Afghan Cabinet, raising the women's share to 20 percent--still too low, but at least fulfillment of our promise.\",\n                \"We are determined to name qualified women as ambassadors and to increase their number as deputy ministers, and we are working hard to attract and train a whole new cadre of women technocrats into our government.

Unfortunately, we have inherited that skill for 3 million years. Since as far back as the invasion of Alexander and the more modern expulsion of the Soviet Union, Afghans have shown that we will protect our country against foreign attack, no matter how steep the price or how well armed the intruder.\",\n                \"I have no doubt that, provided that they continue to receive equipment and training, our Armed Forces will stand firm against any efforts by outside extremists to build a base inside our territory; but we must now show that we can also bring peace.\",\n                \"Our strategy is built around three initiatives. The first is to use our diplomacy to build a community of nations that is committed to stability in Asia. Dr. Abdullah and I have met with the leaders of Pakistan, India, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, and China, among others. Their commitment for building mutual security across nations includes ending the financing and sanctuary for extremist groups.\",\n                \"The second initiative is to build up the ability of our Armed Forces to project the elected government across our entire national territory. Our partnership with the United States and ISAF, now transformed into the resolute support mission, has given Afghanistan a well-trained army that is bringing the fight to the enemy. We are no longer on the defensive, but have taken the offensive.\",\n                \"On December 31, 2014, all combat operations were handed over to Afghan National Security Forces.

The Taliban need to choose not to be al Qaeda and be our friend; and, if they choose to be our friend, they will be welcome to be part of the fabric of our society.\",\n                \"Many believe themselves to be patriots rebelling against the corruption and criminality that they saw in their towns and villages.
